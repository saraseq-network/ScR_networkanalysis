"Multiple species animal movements: network properties, disease dynamics and the impact of targeted control actions","Cardenas, NC; Sykes, AL; Lopes, FPN; Machado, G","Infectious diseases in livestock are well-known to infect multiple hosts and persist through a combination of within- and between-host transmission pathways. Uncertainty remains about the epidemic dynamics of diseases being introduced on farms with more than one susceptible host species. Here, we describe multi-host contact networks and elucidate the potential of disease spread through farms with multiple hosts. Four years of between-farm animal movement among all farms of a Brazilian state were described through a static and monthly snapshot of network representations. We developed a stochastic multilevel model to simulate scenarios in which infection was seeded into single host and multi-host farms to quantify disease spread potential, and simulate network-based control actions used to evaluate the reduction of secondarily infected farms. We showed that the swine network was more connected than cattle and small ruminants in both the static and monthly snapshots. The small ruminant network was highly fragmented, however, contributed to interconnecting farms, with other hosts acting as intermediaries throughout the networks. When a single host was initially infected, secondary infections were observed across farms with all other species. Our stochastic multi-host model demonstrated that targeting the top 3.25% of the farms ranked by degree reduced the number of secondarily infected farms. The results of the simulation highlight the importance of considering multi-host dynamics and contact networks while designing surveillance and preparedness control strategies against pathogens known to infect multiple species.",2022,VETERINARY RESEARCH,53,1,,10.1186/s13567-022-01031-2,#57,Cardenas 2022
Estimation of swine movement network at farm level in the US from the Census of Agriculture data,"Moon, SA; Ferdousi, T; Self, A; Scoglio, CM","Swine movement networks among farms/operations are an important source of information to understand and prevent the spread of diseases, nearly nonexistent in the United States. An understanding of the movement networks can help the policymakers in planning effective disease control measures. The objectives of this work are: (1) estimate swine movement probabilities at the county level from comprehensive anonymous inventory and sales data published by the United States Department of Agriculture - National Agriculture Statistics Service database, (2) develop a network based on those estimated probabilities, and (3) analyze that network using network science metrics. First, we use a probabilistic approach based on the maximum information entropy method to estimate the movement probabilities among different swine populations. Then, we create a swine movement network using the estimated probabilities for the counties of the central agricultural district of Iowa. The analysis of this network has found evidence of the small-world phenomenon. Our study suggests that the US swine industry may be vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks because of the small-world structure of its movement network. Our system is easily adaptable to estimate movement networks for other sets of data, farm animal production systems, and geographic regions.",2019,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,9,,,10.1038/s41598-019-42616-w,#58,Moon 2019
"The Distribution of Bovine Tuberculosis in Cattle Farms Is Linked to Cattle Trade and Badger-Mediated Contact Networks in South-Western France, 2007-2015","Bouchez-Zacria, M; Courcoul, A; Durand, B","Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), mainly caused by Mycobacterium bovis, can affect domestic and wild animals as well as humans. Identifying the major transmission mechanisms in an area is necessary for disease control and management. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the involvement of different types of contact in M. bovis transmission between cattle farms of south-western France between 2007 and 2015. We analyzed an empirical contact network of cattle farms as nodes, with known infection status and molecular types (16 circulated during the study period of which 14 affected only cattle and two both badgers and cattle). Edges were based on cattle trade data (T-edges) and on spatial neighborhood relationships between farms, either direct (P-edges) or badger-mediated, when two farms neighbored the same badger home range (B-edges), or two distinct but neighboring badger home ranges (D-edges). Edge types were aggregated so that the contact network contained only unique edges labeled by one or several edge types. The association between the contact network structure and bTB infection status was assessed using a non-parametric test, each molecular type being considered a marker of an independent epidemic. Using a logistic regression model, we estimated the contribution of each edge type to the probability for an edge originating from an infected farm to end at another infected farm. A total number of 1946 cattle farms were included in the study and were linked by 54,243 edges. Within this contact network, infected farms (whatever the molecular type) always belonged to the same component, suggesting the contact network may have supported bTB spread among those farms. A significant association between the pattern of bTB-infected farms and the structure of the contact network was observed when all the molecular types were simultaneously considered. The logistic regression model showed a significant association between M. bovis infection in direct neighbors of infected farms and the connection by T-, B- and D-edges, with odds-ratios of 7.4, 1.9, and 10.4, respectively. These results indicate a multifactorial M. bovis transmission between cattle farms of the studied area, with varying implication levels of the trade, pasture and badger networks according to the molecular type.",2018,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,5,,,10.3389/fvets.2018.00173,#68,Bouchez-Zacria 2018
A multi-analysis approach for space-time and economic evaluation of risks related with livestock diseases: The example of FMD in Peru,"Martínez-López, B; Ivorra, B; Fernández-Carrión, E; Perez, AM; Medel-Herrero, A; Sánchez-Vizcaíno, F; Gortázar, C; Ramos, AM; Sánchez-Vizcaíno, JM","This study presents a multi-disciplinary decision-support tool, which integrates geostatistics, social network analysis (SNA), spatial-stochastic spread model, economic analysis and mapping/visualization capabilities for the evaluation of the sanitary and socioeconomic impact of livestock diseases under diverse epidemiologic scenarios. We illustrate the applicability of this tool using foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Peru as an example. The approach consisted on a flexible, multistep process that may be easily adapted based on data availability. The first module (ml) uses a geo-statistical approach for the estimation (if needed) of the distribution and abundance of susceptible population (in the example here, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, and camelids) at farm-level in the region or country of interest (Peru). The second module (mII) applies SNA for evaluating the farm-to-farm contact patterns and for exploring the structure and frequency of between-farm animal movements as a proxy for potential disease introduction or spread. The third module (mill) integrates mI-II outputs into a spatial-stochastic model that simulates within- and between-farm FMD-transmission. The economic module (mIV) connects outputs from mI III to provide an estimate of associated direct and indirect costs. A visualization module (mV) is also implemented to graph and map the outputs of module I IV. After 1000 simulated epidemics, the mean (95% probability interval) number of outbreaks, infected animals, epidemic duration, and direct costs were 37 (1, 1164), 2152 (1, 13, 250), 63 days (0, 442), and US$ 1.2 million (1072, 9.5 million), respectively. Spread of disease was primarily local (<4.5 km), but geolocation and type of index farm strongly influenced the extent and spatial patterns of an epidemic. The approach is intended to support decisions in the last phase of the FMD eradication program in Peru, in particular to inform and support the implementation of riskbased surveillance and livestock insurance systems that may help to prevent and control potential FMD virus incursions into Peru.

Analysis of Swine Movements in a Province in Northern Vietnam and Application in the Design of Surveillance Strategies for Infectious Diseases,"Baudon, E; Fournié, G; Hiep, DT; Pham, TTH; Duboz, R; Gély, M; Peiris, M; Cowling, BJ; Ton, VD; Peyre, M","While swine production is rapidly growing in South-East Asia, the structure of the swine industry and the dynamic of pig movements have not been well-studied. However, this knowledge is a prerequisite for understanding the dynamic of disease transmission in swine populations and designing cost-effective surveillance strategies for infectious diseases. In this study, we assessed the farming and trading practices in the Vietnamese swine familial farming sector, which accounts for most pigs in Vietnam, and for which disease surveillance is a major challenge. Farmers from two communes of a Red River Delta Province (northern Vietnam) were interviewed, along with traders involved in pig transactions. Major differences in the trade structure were observed between the two communes. One commune had mainly transversal trades, that is between farms of equivalent sizes, whereas the other had pyramidal trades, that is from larger to smaller farms. Companies and large familial farrow-to-finish farms were likely to act as major sources of disease spread through pig sales, demonstrating their importance for disease control. Familial fattening farms with high pig purchases were at greater risk of disease introduction and should be targeted for disease detection as part of a risk-based surveillance. In contrast, many other familial farms were isolated or weakly connected to the swine trade network limiting their relevance for surveillance activities. However, some of these farms used boar hiring for breeding, increasing the risk of disease spread. Most familial farms were slaughtering pigs at the farm or in small local slaughterhouses, making the surveillance at the slaughterhouse inefficient. In terms of spatial distribution of the trades, the results suggested that northern provinces were highly connected and showed some connection with central and southern provinces. These results are useful to develop risk-based surveillance protocols for disease detection in the swine familial sector and to make recommendations for disease control.",2017,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,64,2,411-424,10.1111/tbed.12380,#71,Baudon 2017
Prediction of Pig Trade Movements in Different European Production Systems Using Exponential Random Graph Models,"Relun, A; Grosbois, V; Alexandrov, T; Sánchez-Vizcaíno, JM; Waret-Szkuta, A; Molia, S; Etter, EMC; Martinez-López, B","In most European countries, data regarding movements of live animals are routinely collected and can greatly aid predictive epidemic modeling. However, the use of complete movements' dataset to conduct policy-relevant predictions has been so far limited by the massive amount of data that have to be processed (e.g., in intensive commercial systems) or the restricted availability of timely and updated records on animal movements (e.g., in areas where small-scale or extensive production is predominant). The aim of this study was to use exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to reproduce, understand, and predict pig trade networks in different European production systems. Three trade networks were built by aggregating movements of pig batches among premises (farms and trade operators) over 2011 in Bulgaria, Extremadura (Spain), and Cotes-d'Armor (France), where small-scale, extensive, and intensive pig production are predominant, respectively. Three ERGMs were fitted to each network with various demographic and geographic attributes of the nodes as well as six internal network configurations. Several statistical and graphical diagnostic methods were applied to assess the goodness of fit of the models. For all systems, both exogenous (attribute-based) and endogenous (network-based) processes appeared to govern the structure of pig trade network, and neither alone were capable of capturing all aspects of the network structure. Geographic mixing patterns strongly structured pig trade organization in the small-scale production system, whereas belonging to the same company or keeping pigs in the same housing system appeared to be key drivers of pig trade, in intensive and extensive production systems, respectively. Heterogeneous mixing between types of production also explained a part of network structure, whichever production system considered. Limited information is thus needed to capture most of the global structure of pig trade networks. Such findings will be useful to simplify trade networks analysis and better inform European policy makers on risk-based and more cost-effective prevention and control against swine diseases such as African swine fever, classical swine fever, or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome.",2017,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,4,,,10.3389/fvets.2017.00027,#73,Relun 2017
Modeling the live-pig trade network in Georgia: Implications for disease prevention and control,"Kukielka, EA; Martínez-López, B; Beltrán-Alcrudo, D","Live pig trade patterns, drivers and characteristics, particularly in backyard predominant systems, remain largely unexplored despite their important contribution to the spread of infectious diseases in the swine industry. A better understanding of the pig trade dynamics can inform the implementation of risk-based and more cost-effective prevention and control programs for swine diseases. In this study, a semi-structured questionnaire elaborated by FAO and implemented to 487 farmers was used to collect data regarding basic characteristics about pig demographics and live-pig trade among villages in the country of Georgia, where very scarce information is available. Social network analysis and exponential random graph models were used to better understand the structure, contact patterns and main drivers for pig trade in the country. Results indicate relatively infrequent (a total of 599 shipments in one year) and geographically localized (median Euclidean distance between shipments = 6.08 km; IQR = 0-13.88 km) pig movements in the studied regions. The main factors contributing to live-pig trade movements among villages were being from the same region (i.e., local trade), usage of a middleman or a live animal market to trade live pigs by at least one farmer in the village, and having a large number of pig farmers in the village. The identified villages' characteristics and structural network properties could be used to inform the design of more cost-effective surveillance systems in a country which pig industry was recently devastated by African swine fever epidemics and where backyard production systems are predominant.",2017,PLOS ONE,12,6,,10.1371/journal.pone.0178904,#75,Kukielka 2017
Social network analysis provides insights into African swine fever epidemiology,"Lichoti, JK; Davies, J; Kitala, PM; Githigia, SM; Okoth, E; Maru, Y; Bukachi, SA; Bishop, RP","Pig movements play a significant role in the spread of economically important infectious diseases such as the African swine fever. Characterization of movement networks between pig farms and through other types of farm and household enterprises that are involved in pig value chains can provide useful information on the role that different participants in the networks play in pathogen transmission. Analysis of social networks that underpin these pig movements can reveal pathways that are important in the transmission of disease, trade in commodities, the dissemination of information and the influence of behavioural norms. We assessed pig movements among pig keeping households within West Kenya and East Uganda and across the shared Kenya Uganda border in the study region, to gain insight into within country and trans-boundary pig movements. Villages were sampled using a randomized cluster design. Data were collected through interviews in 2012 and 2013 from 683 smallholder pig-keeping households in 34 villages. NodeXL software was used to describe pig movement networks at village level. The pig movement and trade networks were localized and based on close social networks involving family ties, friendships and relationships with neighbours. Pig movement network modularity ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 and exhibited good community structure within the network implying an easy flow of knowledge and adoption of new attitudes and beliefs, but also promoting an enhanced rate of disease transmission. The average path length of 5 defined using NodeXL, indicated that disease could easily reach every node in a cluster. Cross-border boar service between Uganda and Kenya was also recorded. Unmonitored trade in both directions was prevalent. While most pig transactions in the absence of disease, were at a small scale (<5 km) and characterized by regular agistment, most pig sales during ASF outbreaks were to traders or other farmers from outside the sellers' village at a range of >10 km. The close social relationships between actors in pig movement networks indicate the potential for possible interventions to develop shared norms and mutually accepted protocols amongst smallholder pig keepers to better manage the risk of ASF introduction and transmission.

Understanding Pig and Poultry Trade Networks and Farming Practices Within the Pacific Islands as a Basis for Surveillance,"Brioudes, A; Gummow, B","Pacific Island countries have large pig and poultry populations. Yet little is known about patterns of contact between animals and how this influences disease spread in these islands. The objectives of this study were to examine farmer practices and the movements of pig and poultry within the Pacific Islands using questionnaires and social network analysis (SNA) tools to understand disease spread in the region. Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted in Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands and Vanuatu with interviews of 310 pig farmers and 491 poultry farmers. Pacific Island farmers were found to have few animals (median = 7 pigs/farm, IQR 4-12), (median = 50 chicken/farm, IQR 23-52), (median = 10 ducks/farm, IQR 4-25), (median = 12 Muscovy ducks/farm, IQR 7-28) and a diversified number of species. A large proportion of farmers (44.6-1.3%) do not implement any preventive or control measures, yet the majority (80.6-88%) did not experience any animal diseases over the past 12 months. Most farmers never ask for veterinary care, never engage in laboratory testing and do not report when their animals show clinical signs. Many pig farmers (31.8%) trade within their communities only and sell (24.5%) directly to consumers which reduces the risk of diseases spreading. Our results show an association between farmers that report having had disease on their farm in the past 12 months and movements of animals on and off their farms. The capitals of the studied provinces in PNG, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands were identified as the most connected nodes of both pig and poultry trade, while Fiji networks appeared much less connected. Our study found that farmer practices increased the risk of disease spread, but this was currently limited by trading practices. The SNA results serve as a basis for more targeted disease surveillance and better use of available resources for disease prevention and control.",2017,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,64,1,284-299,10.1111/tbed.12370,#77,Brioudes 2017
Impact of Network Activity on the Spread of Infections Diseases through the German Pig Trade Network,"Lebl, K; Lentz, HHK; Pinior, B; Selhorst, T","The trade of livestock is an important and growing economic sector, but it is also a major factor in the spread of diseases. The spreading of diseases in a trade network is likely to be influenced by how often existing trade connections are active. The activity a is defined as the mean frequency of occurrences of existing trade links, thus 0 < alpha <= 1. The observed German pig trade network had an activity of alpha = 0.11, thus each existing trade connection between two farms was, on average, active at about 10% of the time during the observation period 2008-2009. The aim of this study is to analyze how changes in the activity level of the German pig trade network influence the probability of disease outbreaks, size, and duration of epidemics for different disease transmission probabilities. Thus, we want to investigate the question, whether it makes a difference for a hypothetical spread of an animal disease to transport many animals at the same time or few animals at many times. A SIR model was used to simulate the spread of a disease within the German pig trade network. Our results show that for transmission probabilities < 1, the outbreak probability increases in the case of a decreased frequency of animal transports, peaking range of a from 0.05 to 0.1. However, for the final outbreak size, we find that a threshold exists such that finite outbreaks occur only above a critical value of a, which is similar to 0.1, and therefore in proximity of the observed activity level. Thus, although the outbreak probability increased when decreasing a, these outbreaks affect only a small number of farms. The duration of the epidemic peaks at an activity level in the range of alpha = 0.2-0.3. Additionally, the results of our simulations show that even small changes in the activity level of the German pig trade network would have dramatic effects on outbreak probability, outbreak size, and epidemic duration. Thus, we can conclude and recommend that the network activity is an important aspect, which should be taken into account when modeling the spread of diseases within trade networks.",2016,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,3,,,10.3389/fvets.2016.00048,#78,Lebl 2016
A New Approach for Rapidly Assessing the Risk of Aujeszky's Disease Reintroduction into a Disease-free Spanish Territory by Analysing the Movement of Live Pigs and Potential Contacts with Wild Boar,"Vicente-Rubiano, M; Martínez-López, B; Sánchez-Vizcaíno, F; Sánchez-Vizcaíno, JM","Aujeszky's disease (AD) causes significant economic losses in the Spanish pig sector due to import trade restrictions imposed by disease-free countries. Most regions of Spain have achieved 'low AD prevalence' status as a result of an intensive national AD eradication programme involving vaccination and other measures. However, to achieve AD-free status that would eliminate trade restrictions, vaccination must be stopped. For this final stage of eradication, up to date and reliable estimates of the risk of AD reintroduction are essential. Here, we propose an approach based on spatio-temporal scan statistics that the assesses risk of AD reintroduction in a disease-free territory by analysing the two most frequent risk pathways: movement of live domestic pigs and contact with wildlife reservoirs. The approach is illustrated using the case of Navarre, one of the first Spanish regions which plan to stop vaccination. Moreover, direct contacts among pig farms in Navarre were used to evaluate the potential spread of AD in the event of reintroduction. Areas at highest risk of AD reintroduction were in the southern part of the region during the second half of the year through pig movements and in the western and east-central parts of Navarre through contact with wild boars. Northern Navarre, despite having the highest density of pig farms, seems to be at low risk of AD reintroduction. Analysing the network of pig movements within Navarre revealed distinct northern and southern compartments that may be used in preventive compartmentalization strategies to reduce potential risk of AD re-infection in the scenario without vaccination. The approach described here may be extended to other regions and may be useful for guiding risk-based measures that reduce the risk of AD re-infection in a more cost-effective manner. Such analysis in Spain may allow authorities to stop vaccination in the safest possible way.",2014,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,61,4,350-361,10.1111/tbed.12041,#80,Vicente-Rubiano 2014
Analysis of patterns of livestock movements in the Cattle Corridor of Uganda for risk-based surveillance of infectious diseases,"Hasahya, E; Thakur, K; Dione, MM; Kerfua, SD; Mugezi, I; Lee, HS","IntroductionThe knowledge of animal movements is key to formulating strategic animal disease control policies and carrying out targeted surveillance. This study describes the characteristics of district-level cattle, small ruminant, and pig trade networks in the Cattle Corridor of Uganda between 2019 and 2021. MethodologyThe data for the study was extracted from 7,043 animal movement permits (AMPs) obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) of Uganda. Most of the data was on cattle (87.2%), followed by small ruminants (11.2%) and pigs (1.6%). Two types of networks representing animal shipments between districts were created for each species based on monthly (n = 30) and seasonal (n = 10) temporal windows. Measures of centrality and cohesiveness were computed for all the temporal windows and our analysis identified the most central districts in the networks. ResultsThe median in-degree for monthly networks ranged from 0-3 for cattle, 0-1 for small ruminants and 0-1 for pigs. The highest median out-degrees for cattle, small ruminant and pig monthly networks were observed in Lira, Oyam and Butambala districts, respectively. Unlike the pig networks, the cattle and small ruminant networks were found to be of small-world and free-scale topologies. DiscussionThe cattle and small ruminant trade movement networks were also found to be highly connected, which could facilitate quick spread of infectious animal diseases across these networks. The findings from this study highlighted the significance of characterizing animal movement networks to inform surveillance, early detection, and subsequent control of infectious animal disease outbreaks.",2023,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,10,,,10.3389/fvets.2023.1095293,#81,Hasahya 2023
Spatio-temporal network analysis of pig trade to inform the design of risk-based disease surveillance,"Cardenas, NC; VanderWaal, K; Veloso, FP; Galvis, JOA; Amaku, M; Grisi, JHH","Network analysis is a powerful tool to describe, estimate, and predict the role of pig trade in the spread of pathogens and generate essential patterns that can be used to understand, prevent, and mitigate possible outbreaks. This study aimed to describe the network between premises such as production herds, slaughterhouses, and traders of pig movements and identify heterogeneities in the connectivity of premises in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, using social network analysis (SNA). We used static and temporal network approaches to describe pig trade in the state by quantifying network attributes using SNA parameters, such as causal fidelity, loyalty, the proportion of node-loyalty, resilience of outgoing contact chains, and communities. Two indexes were implemented, the first one is a normalized index based on SNA-farm level measures and other index-based SNA-farm level measures considering the swineherd population size from all premises, both indexes were summarized by a municipality to target and rank surveillance activities. Within Santa Catarina, the southwest region played a key role in that 80 % of trade was concentrated in this region, and thus acted as a hub in the network. Besides, nine communities were found. The results also showed that premises were highly connected in the static network, with the network exhibiting low levels of fragmentation and loyalty. Also, just 11 % of the paths in the static network existed in the temporal network which accounted for the order in which edges occurred. Therefore, the use of time-respecting-paths was essential to not overestimate potential transmission pathways and outbreak sizes. Compared to static networks, the application of temporal network approaches was more suitable to capture the dynamics of pig trade and should be used to inform the design of riskbased disease surveillance.",2021,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,189,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105314,#82,Cardenas 2021
Network analysis of pig movements: Loyalty patterns and contact chains of different holding types in Denmark,"Schulz, J; Boklund, A; Halasa, THB; Toft, N; Lentz, HHK","Understanding animal movements is an important factor for the development of meaningful surveillance and control programs, but also for the development of disease spread models. We analysed the Danish pig movement network using static and temporal network analysis tools to provide deeper insight in the connection between holdings dealing with pigs, such as breeding and multiplier herds, production herds, slaughterhouses or traders. Pig movements, which occurred between 1st January 2006 and 31st December 2015 in Denmark, were summarized to investigate temporal trends such as the number of active holdings, the number of registered movements and the number of pigs moved. To identify holdings and holding types with potentially higher risk for introduction or spread of diseases via pig movements, we determined loyalty patterns, annual network components and contact chains for the 24 registered holding types. The total number of active holdings as well as the number of pig movements decreased during the study period while the holding sizes increased. Around 60-90% of connections between two pig holdings were present in two consecutive years and around one third of the connections persisted within the considered time period. Weaner herds showed the highest level of in-loyalty, whereas we observed an intermediate level of in-loyalty for all breeding sites and for production herds. Boar stations, production herds and trade herds showed a high level of out-loyalty. Production herds constituted the highest proportion of holdings in the largest strongly connected component. All production sites showed low levels of in-going contact chains and we observed a high level of out-going contact chain for breeding and multiplier herds. Except for livestock auctions, all transit sites also showed low levels of out-going contact chains. Our results reflect the pyramidal structure of the underlying network. Based on the considered disease, the time frame for the calculation of network measurements needs to be adapted. Using these adapted values for loyalty and contact chains might help to identify holdings with high potential of spreading diseases and thus limit the outbreak size or support control or eradication of the considered pathogen.",2017,PLOS ONE,12,6,,10.1371/journal.pone.0179915,#83,Schulz 2017
Network analysis of pig movement data as an epidemiological tool: an Austrian case study,"Puspitarani, GA; Fuchs, R; Fuchs, K; Ladinig, A; Desvars-Larrive, A","Animal movements represent a major risk for the spread of infectious diseases in the domestic swine population. In this study, we adopted methods from social network analysis to explore pig trades in Austria. We used a dataset of daily records of swine movements covering the period 2015-2021. We analyzed the topology of the network and its structural changes over time, including seasonal and long-term variations in the pig production activities. Finally, we studied the temporal dynamics of the network community structure. Our findings show that the Austrian pig production was dominated by small-sized farms while spatial farm density was heterogeneous. The network exhibited a scale-free topology but was very sparse, suggesting a moderate impact of infectious disease outbreaks. However, two regions (Upper Austria and Styria) may present a higher structural vulnerability. The network also showed very high assortativity between holdings from the same federal state. Dynamic community detection revealed a stable behavior of the clusters. Yet trade communities did not correspond to sub-national administrative divisions and may be an alternative zoning approach to managing infectious diseases. Knowledge about the topology, contact patterns, and temporal dynamics of the pig trade network can support optimized risk-based disease control and surveillance strategies.",2023,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,13,1,,10.1038/s41598-023-36596-1,#84,Puspitarani 2023
"Spatio-temporal patterns and movement analysis of pigs from smallholder farms and implications for African swine fever spread, Limpopo province, South Africa","Fasina, FO; Mokoele, JM; Spencer, BT; van Leengoed, LAML; Bevis, Y; Booysen, I","Infectious and zoonotic disease outbreaks have been linked to increasing volumes of legal and illegal trade. Spatio-temporal and trade network analyses have been used to evaluate the risks associated with these challenges elsewhere, but few details are available for the pig sector in South Africa. Regarding pig diseases, Limpopo province is important as the greater part of the province falls within the African swine fever control area. Emerging small-scale pig farmers in Limpopo perceived pig production as an important means of improving their livelihood and an alternative investment. They engage in trading and marketing their products with a potential risk to animal health, because the preferred markets often facilitate potential long-distance spread and disease dispersal over broad geographic areas. In this study, we explored the interconnectedness of smallholder pig farmers in Limpopo, determined the weaknesses and critical control points, and projected interventions that policy makers can implement to reduce the risks to pig health. The geo-coordinates of surveyed farms were used to draw maps, links and networks. Predictive risks to pigs were determined through the analyses of trade networks, and the relationship to previous outbreaks of African swine fever was postulated. Auction points were identified as high-risk areas for the spread of animal diseases. Veterinary authorities should prioritise focused surveillance and diagnostic efforts in Limpopo. Early disease detection and prompt eradication should be targeted and messages promoting enhanced biosecurity to smallholder farmers are advocated. The system may also benefit from the restructuring of marketing and auction networks. Since geographic factors and networks can rapidly facilitate pig disease dispersal over large areas, a multi-disciplinary approach to understanding the complexities that exist around the animal disease epidemiology becomes mandatory.",2015,ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH,82,1,,10.4102/ojvr.v82i1.795,#86,Fasina 2015
Pig traders' networks on the Kenya-Uganda border highlight potential for mitigation of African swine fever virus transmission and improved ASF disease risk management,"Lichoti, JK; Davies, J; Maru, Y; Kitala, PM; Githigia, SM; Okoth, E; Bukachi, SA; Okuthe, S; Bishop, RP","We applied social network analysis to pig trader networks on the Kenya-Uganda border. Social network analysis is a recently developed tool, which is useful for understanding value chains and improving disease control policies. We interviewed a sample of 33 traders about their experiences with trade and African swine fever (ASF), analyzed the networks they generated in purchasing pigs and selling pork and their potential contribution to modulating dissemination of the ASF virus (ASFV). The majority of the traders were aware of clinical signs of ASF and the risk of trade transmitting ASFV. Most said they avoided buying pigs from ASF outbreak villages or sick pigs but their experiences also indicated that inadvertent purchase was relatively common. Traders had early knowledge of outbreaks since they were contacted by farmers who had heard rumours and wanted to sell their pigs to avoid the risk of them dying. Individual traders bought pigs in up to nine villages, and up to six traders operated in a village. Although each trade typically spanned less than 5 km, networks of the various traders, comprising movements of pigs from source villages to slaughter slabs/sites and retail outlets, and movement of pork to villages where it was consumed, linked up indirectly across the 100 km x 50 km study area and revealed several trade pathways across the Kenya-Uganda border. ASF could potentially spread across this area and beyond through sequential pig and pork transactions.Regulation of the pig and pork trade was minimal in practice. The risk of ASFV being spread by traders was compounded by their use of poorly constructed slaughter slabs/sites with open drainage, ineffective or non-existent meat inspection services, lack of provision for biosecurity in the value chain, and sales of pork to customers who were unaware of the risks to their own pigs from contact with ASF infected pork. More effective regulation is warranted. However, limitations on government capacity, together with the strong self-interest that established traders have in reducing the disruption and financial losses that outbreaks cause, highlight the importance of governments and traders co-developing an approach to ASF control. Formation of trader organizations or common interest groups warrants government support as an important step in engaging traders in developing and implementing effective approaches to reduce the risk of ASF outbreaks.

Spatial and Functional Organization of Pig Trade in Different European Production Systems: Implication for Disease Prevention and Control,"Relun, A; Grosbois, V; Sánchez-Vizcaino, JM; Alexandrov, T; Feliziani, F; Waret-Szkuta, A; Molia, S; Etter, EMC; Martínez-López, B","Understanding the complexity of live pig trade organization is a key factor to predict and control major infectious diseases, such as classical swine fever (CSF) or African swine fever (ASF). Whereas the organization of pig trade has been described in several European countries with indoor commercial production systems, little information is available on this organization in other systems, such as outdoor or small-scale systems. The objective of this study was to describe and compare the spatial and functional organization of live pig trade in different European countries and different production systems. Data on premise characteristics and pig movements between premises were collected during 2011 from Bulgaria, France, Italy, and Spain, which swine industry is representative of most of the production systems in Europe (i.e., commercial vs. small-scale and outdoor vs. indoor). Trade communities were identified in each country using the Walktrap algorithm. Several descriptive and network metrics were generated at country and community levels. Pig trade organization showed heterogeneous spatial and functional organization. Trade communities mostly composed of indoor commercial premises were identified in western France, northern Italy, northern Spain, and north-western Bulgaria. They covered large distances, overlapped in space, demonstrated both scale-free and small-world properties, with a role of trade operators and multipliers as key premises. Trade communities involving outdoor commercial premises were identified in western Spain, south-western and central France. They were more spatially clustered, demonstrated scalefree properties, with multipliers as key premises. Small-scale communities involved the majority of premises in Bulgaria and in central and Southern Italy. They were spatially clustered and had scale-free properties, with key premises usually being commercial production premises. These results indicate that a disease might spread very differently according to the production system and that key premises could be targeted to more cost-effectively control diseases. This study provides useful epidemiological information and parameters that could be used to design risk-based surveillance strategies or to more accurately model the risk of introduction or spread of devastating swine diseases, such as ASF, CSF, or foot-and-mouth disease.",2016,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,3,,,10.3389/fvets.2016.00004,#89,Relun 2016
Exploring pig trade patterns to inform the design of risk-based disease surveillance and control strategies,"Guinat, C; Relun, A; Wall, B; Morris, A; Dixon, L; Pfeiffer, DU","An understanding of the patterns of animal contact networks provides essential information for the design of risk-based animal disease surveillance and control strategies. This study characterises pig movements throughout England and Wales between 2009 and 2013 with a view to characterising spatial and temporal patterns, network topology and trade communities. Data were extracted from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)'s RADAR (Rapid Analysis and Detection of Animal-related Risks) database, and analysed using descriptive and network approaches. A total of 61,937,855 pigs were moved through 872,493 movements of batches in England and Wales during the 5-year study period. Results show that the network exhibited scale-free and small-world topologies, indicating the potential for diseases to quickly spread within the pig industry. The findings also provide suggestions for how risk-based surveillance strategies could be optimised in the country by taking account of highly connected holdings, geographical regions and time periods with the greatest number of movements and pigs moved, as these are likely to be at higher risk for disease introduction. This study is also the first attempt to identify trade communities in the country, information which could be used to facilitate the pig trade and maintain disease-free status across the country in the event of an outbreak.",2016,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,6,,,10.1038/srep28429,#90,Guinat 2016
Network analysis of live pig movements in North Macedonia: Pathways for disease spread,"O'Hara, KC; Beltrán-Alcrudo, D; Hovari, M; Tabakovski, B; Martínez-López, B","Globalization of trade, and the interconnectivity of animal production systems, continues to challenge efforts to control disease. A better understanding of trade networks supports development of more effective strategies for mitigation for transboundary diseases like African swine fever (ASF), classical swine fever (CSF), and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). North Macedonia, bordered to the north and east by countries with ongoing ASF outbreaks, recently reported its first incursion of ASF. This study aimed to describe the distribution of pigs and pig farms in North Macedonia, and to characterize the live pig movement network. Network analyses on movement data from 2017 to 2019 were performed for each year separately, and consistently described weakly connected components with a few primary hubs that most nodes shipped to. In 2019, the network demonstrated a marked decrease in betweenness and increase in communities. Most shipments occurred within 50 km, with movements <6 km being the most common (22.5%). Nodes with the highest indegree and outdegree were consistent across years, despite a large turnover among smallholder farms. Movements to slaughterhouses predominated (85.6%), with movements between farms (5.4%) and movements to market (5.8%) playing a lesser role.

"Pig trade networks through live pig markets in Guangdong Province, China","Li, Y; Huang, BX; Shen, CJ; Cai, C; Wang, YM; Edwards, J; Zhang, GH; Robertson, ID","This study used social network analysis to investigate the indirect contact network between counties through the movement of live pigs through four wholesale live pig markets in Guangdong Province, China. All 14,118 trade records for January and June 2016 were collected from the markets and the patterns of pig trade in these markets analysed. Maps were developed to show the movement pathways. Evaluating the network between source counties was the primary objective of this study. A 1-mode network was developed. Characteristics of the trading network were explored, and the degree, betweenness and closeness were calculated for each source county. Models were developed to compare the impacts of different disease control strategies on the potential magnitude of an epidemic spreading through this network. The results show that pigs from 151 counties were delivered to the four wholesale live pig markets in January and/or June 2016. More batches (truckloads of pigs sourced from one or more piggeries) were traded in these markets in January (8,001) than in June 2016 (6,117). The pigs were predominantly sourced from counties inside Guangdong Province (90%), along with counties in Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and Henan provinces. The major source counties (46 in total) contributed 94% of the total batches during the two-month study period. Pigs were sourced from piggeries located 10 to 1,417 km from the markets. The distribution of the nodes' degrees in both January and June indicates a free-scale network property, and the network in January had a higher clustering coefficient (0.54 vs. 0.39) and a shorter average pathway length (1.91 vs. 2.06) than that in June. The most connected counties of the network were in the central, northern and western regions of Guangdong Province. Compared with randomly removing counties from the network, eliminating counties with higher betweenness, degree or closeness resulted in a greater reduction of the magnitude of a potential epidemic. The findings of this study can be used to inform targeted control interventions for disease spread through this live pig market trade network in south China.",2020,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,67,3,1315-1329,10.1111/tbed.13472,#94,Li 2020
Multilayer network analysis unravels haulage vehicles as a hidden threat to the British swine industry,"Porphyre, T; Bronsvoort, BMD; Gunn, GJ; Correia-Gomes, C","When assessing the role of live animal trade networks in the spread of infectious diseases in livestock, attention has focused mainly on direct movements of animals between premises, whereas the role of haulage vehicles used during transport, an indirect route for disease transmission, has largely been ignored. Here, we have assessed the impact of sharing haulage vehicles from livestock transport service providers on the connectivity between farms as well as on the spread of swine infectious diseases in Great Britain (GB). Using all pig movement records between April 2012 and March 2014 in GB, we built a series of directed and weighted static multiplex networks consisting of two layers of identical nodes, where nodes (farms) are linked either by (a) the direct movement of pigs and (b) the shared use of haulage vehicles. The haulage contact definition integrates the date of the move and the duration Delta s that lorries are left contaminated by pathogens, hence accounting for the temporal aspect of contact events. For increasing Delta s, descriptive network analyses were performed to assess the role of haulage on network connectivity. We then explored how viruses may spread throughout the GB pig sector by computing the reproduction number R. Our results showed that sharing haulage vehicles increases the number of contacts between farms by >50% and represents an important driver of disease transmission. In particular, sharing haulage vehicles, even if Delta s < 1 day, will limit the benefit of the standstill regulation, increase the number of premises that could be infected in an outbreak, and more easily raise R above 1. This work confirms that sharing haulage vehicles has significant potential for spreading infectious diseases within the pig sector. The cleansing and disinfection process of haulage vehicles is therefore a critical control point for disease transmission risk mitigation.",2020,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,67,3,,10.1111/tbed.13459,#97,Porphyre 2020
A stochastic network-based model to simulate farm-level transmission of African swine fever virus in Vietnam,"Lee, HS; Thakur, KK; Long, PT; Dao, TD; Bui, AN; Bui, VN; Quang, HN","African swine fever virus is highly contagious, and mortality rates reach up to 100% depending on the host, virus dose, and the transmission routes. The main objective of this study was to develop a network-based simulation model for the farm-level transmission of ASF virus to evaluate the impact of changes in farm connectivity on ASF spread in Vietnam. A hypothetical population of 1,000 pig farms was created and used for the network-based simulation, where each farm represented a node, and the connection between farms represented an edge. The three scenarios modelled in this way (baseline, low, and high) evaluated the impact of connectivity on disease transmission. The median number of infected farms was higher as the connectivity increased (low: 659, baseline: 968 and high: 993). In addition, we evaluated the impact of the culling strategy on the number of infected farms. A total of four scenarios were simulated depending on the timing of culling after a farm was infected. We found that the timing of culling at 16, 12, 8, and 6 weeks had resulted in a reduction of the number of median infected farms by 81.92%, 91.63%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Finally, our evaluation of the implication of stability of ties between farms indicated that if the farms were to have the same trading partners for at least six months could significantly reduce the median number of infected farms to two (95(th) percentile: 413) than in the basic model. Our study showed that pig movements among farms had a significant influence on the transmission dynamics of ASF virus. In addition, we found that the either timing of culling, reduction in the number of trading partners each farm had, or decreased mean contact rate during the outbreaks were essential to prevent or stop further outbreaks.",2021,PLOS ONE,16,3,,10.1371/journal.pone.0247770,#98,Lee 2021
"Analysis of pig movements across eastern Indonesia, 2009-2010","Leslie, EEC; Christley, RM; Geong, M; Ward, MP; Toribio, JALML","Knowledge of live animal movement through markets and from farm-to-farm is needed to inform strategies for control of trans-boundary animal diseases (TADs) in south-east Asia, particularly due to consumer preference for fresh meat. In eastern Indonesia a TAD of principal interest for control is classical swine fever (CSF) due to its impacts on smallholder farmers. Pig movement is considered a contributor to failure of current CSF control efforts but pig movement patterns are not well understood. This study investigated movement of live pigs in West Timor, Flores and Sumba islands during 2009-2010, with the aim of informing CSF control policies for Nusa Tenggara Timor province. A market survey of 292 pig sellers and 281 pig buyers across nine live pig markets and a farmer survey across 18 villages with 289 smallholder farmers were conducted and information collected on pig movements. The data obtained was used for social network analysis (SNA) on formal (via a market) and informal (village-to-village) movements using information on trading practices, source and destination locations, and the number of pigs being moved. Both inter- and intra-island movements were identified, however inter-island movement was only observed between Flores and Sumba islands. West Timor and Sumba had highly connected networks where large numbers of villages were directly and indirectly linked through pig movement. Further for West Timor, both formal and informal pig movements linked the capital Kupang, on the eastern end of the island to the western districts bordering East Timor connecting all five districts and demonstrating that informal movement transports pigs over distances similar to formal movement on this island. Sumba had a higher potential for pigs to move to a greater number of sequential locations across the entire island. Flores was found to have a more fragmented network, with pig movements concentrated in its eastern or western regions, influenced by terrain. Markets were confirmed as high-risk locations for the introduction and spread of disease, having over 20 contacts (based on in- and out-degree values) depending on operational day. Villages considered high-risk for CSF spread via informal movements were characterised by higher volume of pig exits and/or linkage to higher numbers of other villages. These findings demonstrate that informal movement (often related to cultural practices) can be extensive and the high level of connectivity dictates that control strategies for CSF and other highly transmissible diseases must be formulated at the provincial level and in collaboration with East Timor.

Network analysis of cattle and pig movements in Sweden: Measures relevant for disease control and risk based surveillance,"Nöremark, M; Håkansson, N; Lewerin, SS; Lindberg, A; Jonsson, A","Registration of cattle and pig movements is mandatory in Sweden and all registered movements between farms in the years 2006-2008 were investigated using network analysis. The networks were analysed as monthly and yearly networks, separately per species and with the two species together. Measures that have been previously discussed in relation to outbreaks and disease control were calculated; moreover a measure of the ingoing infection chain was constructed. The ingoing infection chain captures ingoing contacts through other holdings, taking the temporal aspect and sequence of the movements into account. The distribution of the contacts among the holdings was skewed. Many farms had few or no contacts, while others had many, a pattern which has also been described from other countries. The cattle network and the combined network showed a recurring seasonal pattern, while this was not seen in the pig network. The in-degree was not equivalent to the ingoing infection chain; there were holdings with limited direct contacts, but a large number of indirect contacts. The ingoing infection chain could be a useful measure when setting up strategies for disease control and for risk based surveillance as it identifies holdings with many contacts through live animal movements and thus at potentially higher risk for introduction of contagious diseases.

"A traditional cattle trade network in Tak province, Thailand and its potential in the spread of infectious diseases","Khengwa, C; Jongchansittoe, P; Sedwisai, P; Wiratsudakul, A","Cattle in Thailand are traded by cattle dealers in the cattle markets through informal negotiation processes. The present study aimed to explore a traditional cattle trade network and its potential in the spread of infectious diseases. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted in cattle markets located in Tak province, Thailand. A static weighted directed one-mode network was constructed and geographic locations of sources and destinations of animals were plotted. A total of 210 cattle dealers responded to the questionnaires. The cattle trade network contained 112 sources and destinations of animals and 168 trading activities. The highest generalised weighed in- and out-degree centralities and k-core were observed in the same cattle market at 53.4, 106.7 and 4, respectively. Spatially, cattle dealers could transport animals as far as 774.4 km from the original markets and natural barriers such as mountainous areas tended to dictate the trading routes, premises of animals and magnitude of trading activities. Traditional cattle trading patterns described in this study pose some important challenges to veterinary authorities in tailoring effective prevention and control measures for confronting infectious diseases. This study quantitatively analysed the traffic within a network of cattle trade and found a wide range of spatial movements and a high connectivity of markets to sources and destinations of animals, which may accommodate the spread of infectious diseases within the network. This peace time network analysis could help related authorities to better focus on possible infected premises and to immediately respond once an epidemic occurs.",2017,ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE,57,1,152-160,10.1071/AN15043,#104,Khengwa 2017
Risk Analysis of the Transmission Route for the African Swine Fever Virus in Mainland China,"Hu, JH; Pei, X; Sun, GQ; Jin, Z","African swine fever first broke out in mainland China in August 2018 and has caused a substantial loss to China's pig industry. Numerous investigations have confirmed that trades and movements of infected pigs and pork products, feeding pigs with contaminative swills, employees, and vehicles carrying the virus are the main transmission routes of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) in mainland China. However, which transmission route is more risky and what is the specific transmission map are still not clear enough. In this study, we crawl the data related to pig farms and slaughterhouses from Baidu Map by writing the Python language and then construct the pig transport network. Following this, we establish an ASFV transmission model over the network based on probabilistic discrete-time Markov chains. Furthermore, we propose spatiotemporal backward detection and forward transmission algorithms in semi-directed weighted networks. Through the simulation and calculation, the risk of transmission routes is analyzed, and the results reveal that the infection risk for employees and vehicles with the virus is the highest, followed by contaminative swills, and the transportation of pigs and pork products is the lowest; the most likely transmission map is deduced, and it is found that ASFV spreads from northeast China to southwest China and then to west; in addition, the infection risk in each province at different times is assessed, which can provide effective suggestions for the prevention and control of ASFV.",2021,FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS,9,,,10.3389/fphy.2021.785885,#105,Hu 2021
Evaluating the efficacy of regionalisation in limiting high-risk livestock trade movements,"Hidano, A; Carpenter, TE; Stevenson, MA; Gates, MC","Many countries implement regionalisation as a measure to control economically important livestock diseases. Given that regionalisation highlights the difference in disease risk between animal subpopulations, this may discourage herd managers in low-risk areas from purchasing animals from high-risk areas to protect the disease-free status of their herds. Using bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in New Zealand as a case example, we develop a novel network simulation model to predict how much the frequency of cattle movements between different disease control areas (DCAs) could theoretically change if herd managers adopted the safest practices (preferentially purchasing cattle from areas with the lowest risk of bTB), if herd managers adopted the riskiest practices (preferentially purchasing cattle from areas with the greatest risk of bTB), or if herd managers made trade decisions completely at random (purchasing cattle without consideration for bTB disease risk). A modified configuration wiring algorithm was used in the network simulation model to preserve key temporal, spatial, and demographic attributes of cattle movement patterns. The simulated frequencies of cattle movements between DCAs in each of the three behavioural scenarios were compared with the actual frequency of cattle movements that occurred between 1st July 2010 and 30th June 2011. Our results showed that the observed frequency of cattle movements from high-risk areas into low-risk areas was significantly less than if trade decisions were made completely at random, but still significantly greater than if herd managers made the safest possible trade decisions. This suggests that while New Zealand cattle farmers may have adopted risk-averse trading behaviour in response to regionalisation, there are other underlying factors driving livestock trade, such as established supplier-buyer relationships and heterogeneous individual perceptions towards disease risk, which may reduce the potential efficacy of regionalisation as a disease control strategy. Physical constraints and socio-psychological factors that determine herd managers' livestock trading behaviour warrant further studies to better understand how herd managers respond to future livestock disease regulations. The flexibility of a network re-wiring framework presented in this study allows such a behavioural response to be incorporated into a disease simulation model, which will in turn facilitate a better evaluation of disease control strategies.

"Evaluation of the impact of live pig trade network, vaccination coverage and socio-economic factors in the classical swine fever eradication program in Peru","Gómez-Vázquez, JP; Quevedo-Valle, M; Flores, U; Jarufe, KP; Martínez-López, B","Classical swine fever (CSF) is a viral infectious disease of swine with significant economic impact in the affected countries due to the limitation of trade, culling of infected animals and production losses. In Latin America, CSF is endemic in several countries including Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil and Peru. Since 2010, the National Veterinary Services of Peru have been working to better control and eradicate the disease with an intensive vaccination program. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccination program and determine which factors are still contributing to the persistence of the disease in certain regions of Peru. We integrated the data from the vaccination campaign, the live pig movement network and other socioeconomic indicators into a multilevel logistic regression model to evaluate their association with CSF occurrence at district level. The results revealed that high vaccination coverage significantly reduces the risk of CSF occurrence (OR = 0.07), supporting the effectiveness of the vaccination program. Districts belonging to large and medium pig trade network communities (as identified with walktrap algorithm) had higher probability to CSF occurrence (OR = 2.83 and OR = 5.83, respectively). The human development index (HDI) and the presence of a slaughterhouse in the district was also significantly associated with an increased likelihood of CSF occurrence (OR = 1.52 and OR = 3.25, respectively). Districts receiving a high proportion of the movements from districts that were infected in the previous year were also at higher risk of CSF occurrence (OR = 3.30). These results should be useful to guide the prioritization of vaccination strategies and may help to design other intervention strategies (e.g., target education, movement restrictions, etc.) in high-risk areas to more rapidly advance in the eradication of CSF in Peru.",2019,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,162,,29-37,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.10.019,#108,Gómez-Vázquez 2019
Network analysis of pig movements in Ecuador: Strengthening surveillance of classical swine fever,"Acosta, AJ; Cardenas, NC; Pisuna, LM; Galvis, JA; Vinueza, RL; Vasquez, KS; Grisi, JH; Amaku, M; Gonçalves, VS; Ferreira, F","The analysis of domestic pig movements has become useful to understand the disease spread patterns and epidemiology, which facilitates the development of more effective animal diseases control strategies. The aim of this work was to analyse the static and spatial characteristics of the pig network, to identify its trading communities and to study the contribution of the network to the transmission of classical swine fever. In this regard, we used the pig movement records from the National Veterinary Service of Ecuador (2017-2019), using social network analysis and spatial analysis to construct a network with registered premises as nodes and their movements as edges. Furthermore, we also created a network of parishes as its nodes by aggregating their premises movements as edges. The annual network metrics showed an average diameter of 20.33, a number of neighbours of 2.61, a shortest path length of 4.39 and a clustering coefficient of 0.38 (small-world structure). The most frequent movements were to or from markets (55%). Backyard producers made up 89% of the network premises, and the top 2% of parishes (highest degree) contributed to 50% of the movements. The highest frequencies of movements between parishes were in the centre of the country, while the highest frequency of movements to abattoirs was in the south-west. Finally, the pattern of classical swine fever (CSF) disease outbreaks within the Ecuador network was likely the result of network transmission processes. In conclusion, our results represented the first exploratory analysis of domestic pig movements at premise and parish levels. The surveillance system could consider these results to improve its procedures and update the disease control and management policy, and allow the implementation of targeted or risk-based surveillance.",2022,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,69,5,E2898-E2912,10.1111/tbed.14640,#110,Acosta 2022
Exploring cattle movements in Belgium,"Ensoy, C; Faes, C; Welby, S; Van der Stede, Y; Aerts, M","Movement of animals from one farm to another is a potential risk and can lead to the spreading of livestock diseases. Therefore, in order to implement effective control measures, it is important to understand the movement network in a given area. Using the SANITEL data from 2005 to 2009, around 2 million cattle movements in Belgium were traced. Exploratory analysis revealed different spatial structures for the movement of different cattle types: fattening calves are mostly moved to the Antwerp region, adult cattle are moved to different parts in Belgium. Based on these differences, movement of cattle would more likely cause a spread of disease to a larger number of areas in Belgium as compared to the fattening calves.A closer inspection of the spatial and temporal patterns of cattle movement using a weighted negative binomial model, revealed a significant short-distance movement of bovine which could be an important factor contributing to the local spreading of a disease. The model however revealed hot spot areas of movement in Belgium; four areas in the Walloon region (Luxembourg, Hainaut, Namur and Liege) were found as hot spot areas while East and West Flanders are important ""receivers"" of movement. This implies that an introduction of a disease to these Walloon regions could result in a spread toward the East and West Flanders regions, as what happened in the case of Bluetongue BTV-8 outbreak in 2006. The temporal component in the model also revealed a linear trend and short- and long-term seasonality in the cattle movement with a peak around spring and autumn. The result of this explorative analysis enabled the identification of ""hot spots"" in time and space which is important in enhancing any existing monitoring and surveillance system.

Analysis of dairy cattle movements in the northern region of Thailand,"Boonyayatra, S; Wang, YY; Singhla, T; Kongsila, A; VanderWaal, K; Wells, SJ","Dairy farming in northern Thailand is expanding, with dairy cattle populations increasing up to 8% per year. In addition, disease outbreaks frequently occur in this region, especially foot-and-mouth disease and bovine tuberculosis. Our goal was to quantify the underlying pattern of dairy cattle movements in the context of infectious disease surveillance and control as movements have been identified as risk factors for several infectious diseases. Movements at district levels within the northern region and between the northern and other regions from 2010 to 2017 were recorded by the Department of Livestock Development. Analyzed data included origin, destination, date and purpose of the movement, type of premise of origin and destination, and type and number of moved cattle. Social network analysis was performed to demonstrate patterns of dairy cattle movement within and between regions. The total numbers of movements and moved animals were 3,906 and 180,305, respectively. Decreasing trends in both the number of cattle moved and the number of movements were observed from 2010 to 2016, with increases in 2017. The majority (98%) of the animals moved were male dairy calves, followed by dairy cows (1.7%). The main purpose of the movements was for slaughter (96.3%). Most movements (67.4%) were shipments from central to northern regions, involving 87.1% of cattle moved. By contrast, 56% of the movements for growing and selling purposes occurred within the northern region, commonly involving dairy cows. Constructed movement networks showed heterogeneity of connections among districts. Of 110 districts, 28 were found to be influential to the movement networks, among which 11 districts showed high centrality measures in multiple networks stratified for movement purposes and regions, including eight districts in the northern and one district in each of the central, eastern, and lower northeastern regions of Thailand.

Illustration of Different Disease Transmission Routes in a Pig Trade Network by Monopartite and Bipartite Representation,"Büttner, K; Krieter, J","Simple Summary Besides direct animal movements between farms; indirect transmission routes of pathogens can have an immense impact on network structure and disease spread in animal trade networks. This study integrated these indirect transmission routes between farms via transport companies or feed supply as bipartite networks; which were compared to the monopartite animal movements network representing the direct transmission route. Both bipartite networks were projected on farm level to enable a comparison to the monopartite network. The number of edges increased immensely from the monopartite animal movements network to both projected networks. Thus, farms can be highly connected over indirect connections, although they are not directly trading animals. The ranking of the animals according to their centrality parameters, indicating their importance for the network, showed moderate correlations only between the animal movements and the transportation network. The epidemiological models based on the different network representations revealed significantly more infected farms for the networks including indirect transmission routes compared to the direct animal movements. Indirect transmission routes had an immense impact on the outcome of centrality parameters, as well as on the spreading process within the network. This knowledge is needed to understand disease spread and to establish reliable prevention and control measurements. Besides the direct transport of animals, also indirect transmission routes, e.g., contact via contaminated vehicles, have to be considered. In this study, the transmission routes of a German pig trade network were illustrated as a monopartite animal movements network and two bipartite networks including information of the transport company and the feed producer which were projected on farm level (n= 866) to enable a comparison. The networks were investigated with the help of network analysis and formed the basis for epidemiological models to evaluate the impact of different transmission routes on network structure as well as on potential epidemic sizes. The number of edges increased immensely from the monopartite animal movements network to both projected networks. The median centrality parameters revealed clear differences between the three representations. Furthermore, moderate correlation coefficients ranging from 0.55 to 0.68 between the centrality values of the animal movements network and the projected transportation network were obtained. The epidemiological models revealed significantly more infected farms for both projected networks (70% to 100%) compared to the animal movements network (1%). The inclusion of indirect transmission routes had an immense impact on the outcome of centrality parameters as well as on the results of the epidemiological models.",2020,ANIMALS,10,6,,10.3390/ani10061071,#114,Büttner 2020
Analysis of cattle movement networks in Paraguay: Implications for the spread and control of infectious diseases,"Avalos, A; Durand, B; Naranjo, J; Maldonado, V; Canini, L; Zanella, G","Beef exports represent a substantial part of Paraguay's agricultural sector. Cattle movements involve a high risk due to the possible spread of bovine diseases that can have a significant impact on the country's economy. We analyzed cattle movements from 2014 to 2018 using the networks analysis methodology at the holding and district levels at different temporal scales. We built two types of networks to identify network characteristics that may contribute to the spread of two diseases with different epidemiological characteristics: i) a network including all cattle movements to consider the transmission of a disease of rapid spread like foot and mouth disease, and ii) a network including only cow movements to account for bovine brucellosis, a disease of slow spread that occurs mainly in adult females. Network indicators did not vary substantially among the cattle and cow only networks. The holdings/districts included in the largest strongly connected components were distributed throughout the country. Percolation analysis performed at the holding level showed that a large number of holdings should be removed to make the largest strongly connected component disappear. Higher values of the centrality indicators were found for markets than for farms, indicating that they may play an important role in the spread of an infectious disease. At the holding level (but not at the district level), the networks exhibited characteristics of small-world networks. This property may facilitate the spread of foot and mouth disease in case of re-emergence, or of bovine brucellosis in the country through cattle movements. They should be taken into account when implementing surveillance or control measures for these diseases.",2022,PLOS ONE,17,12,,10.1371/journal.pone.0278999,#115,Avalos 2022
Comparison of weighted and unweighted network analysis in the case of a pig trade network in Northern Germany,"Büttner, K; Krieter, J","The analysis of trade networks as well as the spread of diseases within these systems focuses mainly on pure animal movements between farms. However, additional data included as edge weights can complement the informational content of the network analysis. However, the inclusion of edge weights can also alter the outcome of the network analysis. Thus, the aim of the study was to compare unweighted and weighted network analyses of a pork supply chain in Northern Germany and to evaluate the impact on the centrality parameters. Five different weighted network versions were constructed by adding the following edge weights: number of trade contacts, number of delivered livestock, average number of delivered livestock per trade contact, geographical distance and reciprocal geographical distance. Additionally, two different edge weight standardizations were used. The network observed from 2013 to 2014 contained 678 farms which were connected by 1,018 edges. General network characteristics including shortest path structure (e.g. identical shortest paths, shortest path lengths) as well as centrality parameters for each network version were calculated. Furthermore, the targeted and the random removal of farms were performed in order to evaluate the structural changes in the networks. All network versions and edge weight standardizations revealed the same number of shortest paths (1,935). Between 94.4 to 98.9% of the unweighted network and the weighted network versions were identical. Furthermore, depending on the calculated centrality parameters and the edge weight standardization used, it could be shown that the weighted network versions differed from the unweighted network (e.g. for the centrality parameters based on ingoing trade contacts) or did not differ (e.g. for the centrality parameters based on the outgoing trade contacts) with regard to the Spearman Rank Correlation and the targeted removal of farms. The choice of standardization method as well as the inclusion or exclusion of specific farm types (e.g. abattoirs) can alter the results significantly. These facts have to be considered when centrality parameters are to be used for the implementation of prevention and control strategies in the case of an epidemic.",2018,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,156,,49-57,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.05.008,#116,Büttner 2018
When resolution does matter: Modelling indirect contacts in dairy farms at different levels of detail,"Bernini, A; Bolzoni, L; Casagrandi, R","Animal exchanges are considered the major pathway for between-farm transmission of many livestock infectious diseases. Yet, vehicles and operators visiting several farms during routine activities can also contribute to disease spread. Indeed, if contaminated, they can act as mechanical vectors of fomites, generating indirect contacts between visited farms. While data on animal exchanges is often available in national databases, information about the daily itineraries of trucks and operators is rare because difficult to obtain. Thus, some unavoidable approximations have been frequently introduced in the description of indirect contacts in epidemic models. Here, we showed that the level of detail in such description can significantly affect the predictions on disease dynamics. Our analyses focused on the potential spread of a disease in a dairy farm system subject of a comprehensive data collection campaign on calf transportations. We developed two temporal multilayer networks to model between-farm contacts generated by either animal exchanges (direct contacts) and connections operated by trucks moving calves (indirect contacts). The complete model used the full knowledge of the daily trucks' itineraries, while the partial informed one used only a subset of such available information. To account for various conditions of pathogen survival ability and effectiveness of cleaning operations, we performed a sensitivity analysis on trucks' contamination period. An accurate description of indirect contacts was crucial both to correctly predict the final size of epidemics and to identify the seed farms responsible for generating the most severe outbreaks. The importance of detailed information emerged even more clearly in the case of short contamination periods. Our conclusions could be extended to between-farm contacts generated by other vehicles and operators. Overcoming these information gaps would be decisive for a deeper understanding of epidemic spread in livestock and to develop effective control plans.",2019,PLOS ONE,14,10,,10.1371/journal.pone.0223652,#118,Bernini 2019
Analysis of Risk Factors for African Swine Fever in Lombardy to Identify Pig Holdings and Areas Most at Risk of Introduction in Order to Plan Preventive Measures,"Bellini, S; Scaburri, A; Tironi, M; Calò, S","In 2019, the area of the European Union (EU) affected by African swine fever (ASF) expanded progressively in a southwestern direction from Baltic and eastern countries. The disease can severely affect and disrupt regional and international trade of pigs and pork products with serious socioeconomic damages to the pig industry. Lombardy is one of the most important European pig producers and the introduction of ASF into the pig population could adversely affect the entire sector. A study was carried out to identify the farms and territories in the region most at risk of ASF introduction to plan preventive measures. The pig holdings were identified through a descriptive analysis of pig movements and Social Network Analysis (SNA), while, for the identification of the most exposed municipalities, an assessment of risk factors was carried out using the ranking of summed scores attributed to the Z-score. From the analysis, it was found that 109 municipalities and 297 pig holdings of the region were potentially more at risk, and these holdings were selected for target surveillance. This information was provided to veterinary authority to target surveillance in pig farms, in order to early detect a possible incursion of ASF and prevent its spread.",2020,PATHOGENS,9,12,,10.3390/pathogens9121077,#119,Bellini 2020
Emerging infectious diseases may spread across pig trade networks in Thailand once introduced: a network analysis approach,"Wiratsudakul, A; Wongnak, P; Thanapongtharm, W","In Thailand, pork is one of the most consumed meats nationwide. Pig farming is hence an important business in the country. However, 95% of the farms were considered smallholders raising only 50 pigs or less. With limited budgets and resources, the biosecurity level in these farms is relatively low. Pig movements have been previously identified as a risk factor in the spread of infectious diseases. Therefore, the present study aimed to explicitly analyze the pig movement network structure and assess its vulnerability to the spread of emerging diseases in Thailand. We used official electronic records of nationwide pig movements throughout the year 2021 to construct a directed weighted one-mode network. Degree centrality, degree distribution, connected components, network community, and modularity were measured to explore the network architectures and properties. In this network, 484,483 pig movements were captured. In which, 379,948 (78.42%) were moved toward slaughterhouses and hence excluded from further analyses. From the remaining links, we suggested that the pig movement network in Thailand was vulnerable to the spread of emerging infectious diseases. Within the network, we found a strongly connected component (SCC) connecting 1044 subdistricts (38.6% of the nodes), a giant weakly connected component (GWCC) covering 98.2% of the nodes (2654/2704), and inter-regional communities with overall network modularity of 0.68. The disease may rapidly spread throughout the country. A better understanding of the nationwide pig movement networks is helpful in tailoring control interventions to cope with the newly emerged diseases once introduced.",2022,TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION,54,4,,10.1007/s11250-022-03205-8,#120,Wiratsudakul 2022
Combining network analysis with epidemiological data to inform risk-based surveillance: Application to hepatitis E virus (HEV) in pigs,"Salines, M; Andraud, M; Rose, N","Animal movements between farms are a major route of pathogen spread in the pig production sector. This study aimed to pair network analysis and epidemiological data in order to evaluate the impact of animal movements on pathogen prevalence in farms and assess the risk of local areas being exposed to diseases due to incoming movements. Our methodology was applied to hepatitis E virus (HEV), an emerging foodbome zoonotic agent of concern that is highly prevalent in pig farms. Firstly, the pig movement network in France (data recorded in 2013) and the results of a nation-wide seroprevalence study (data collected in 178 farms in 2009) were modelled and analysed. The link between network centrality measures of farms and HEV seroprevalence levels was explored using a generalised linear model. The in-degree and ingoing closeness of farms were found to be statistically associated with high HEV within-farm seroprevalence (p < 0.05). Secondly, the risk of a French departement (i.e. French local administrative areas) being exposed to HEV was calculated by combining the distribution of farm-level HEV prevalence in source depertements with the number of movements coming from those same departements. By doing so, the risk of exposure for departements was mapped, highlighting differences between geographical patterns of HEV prevalence and the risk of exposure to HEV. These results suggest that not only highly prevalent areas but also those having at-risk movements from infected areas should be monitored. Pathogen management and surveillance options in the pig production sector should therefore take animal movements into consideration, paving the way for the development of targeted and risk-based disease surveillance strategies.",2018,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,149,,125-131,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.11.015,#121,Salines 2018
Understanding the poultry trade network in Kenya: Implications for regional disease prevention and control,"McCarron, M; Munyua, P; Cheng, PY; Manga, T; Wanjohi, C; Moen, A; Mounts, A; Katz, MA","Infectious diseases in poultry can spread quickly and lead to huge economic losses. In the past decade, on multiple continents, the accelerated spread of highly pathogenic avian Influenza A (H5N1) virus, often through informal trade networks, has led to the death and culling of hundreds of millions of poultry. Endemic poultry diseases like Newcastle disease and fowl typhoid can also be devastating in many parts of the world. Understanding trade networks in unregulated systems can inform policy decisions concerning disease prevention and containment.From June to December 2008 we conducted a cross-sectional survey of backyard farmers, market traders, and middlemen in 5/8 provinces in Kenya. We administered a standardized questionnaire to each type of actor using convenience, random, snowball, and systematic sampling. Questionnaires addressed frequency, volume, and geography of trade, as well as biosecurity practices. We created a network diagram identifying the most important locations for trade.Of 380 respondents, 51% were backyard farmers, 24% were middlemen and 25% were market traders. Half (50%) of backyard farmers said they raised poultry both for household consumption and for sale. Compared to market traders, middlemen bought their poultry from a greater number of villages (median 4.2 villages for middlemen vs. 1.9 for market traders). Traders were most likely to purchase poultry from backyard farmers. Of the backyard farmers who sold poultry, 51% [Cl 40-63] reported selling poultry to market traders, and 54% [CI 44-63] sold to middlemen. Middlemen moved the largest volume of poultry on a weekly basis (median purchases: 187 birds/week [IQR 2061; median sales: 188 birds/week [IQR 412.5]). The highest numbers of birds were traded in Nairobi Kenya's capital city. Nairobi was the most prominent trading node in the network (61 degrees of centrality). Many smaller sub-networks existed as a result of clustered local trade. Market traders were also integral to the network.The informal poultry trade in Kenya is dependent on the sale of backyard poultry to middlemen and market traders. These two actors play a critical role in poultry movement in Kenya; during any type of disease outbreak middlemen should be targeted for control- and containment-related interventions.

Prediction of the spread of African swine fever through pig and carcass movements in Thailand using a network analysis and diffusion model,"Poolkhet, C; Kasemsuwan, S; Thongratsakul, S; Warrasuth, N; Pamaranon, N; Nuanualsuwan, S","Background: African swine fever (ASF) is a serious contagious viral disease of pigs that affects the pig industry. This study aimed to evaluate the possible African swine fever (ASF) distribution using network analysis and a diffusion model through live pig, carcass, and pig product movement data. Material and Methods: Empirical movement data from Thailand for the year 2019 were used, and expert opinions were sought to evaluate network properties and the diffusion model. The networks were presented as live pig movement and carcass movement data at the provincial and district levels. For network analysis, a descriptive network analysis was performed using outdegree, indegree, betweenness, fragmentation, and power law distribution, and cutpoints were used to describe movement patterns. For the diffusion model, we simulated each network using spatially different infected locations, patterns, and initial infection sites. Based on expert opinions, the initial infection site, the probability of ASF occurrence, and the probability of the initial infected adopter were selected for the appropriated network. In this study, we also simulated networks under varying network parameters to predict the infection speed. Results and Conclusions: The total number of movements recorded was 2,594,364. These were divided into 403,408 (403,408/2,594,364; 15.55%) for live pigs and 2,190,956 (2,190,956/2,594,364; 84.45%) for carcasses. We found that carcass movement at the provincial level showed the highest outdegree (mean = 342.554, standard deviation (SD) = 900.528) and indegree values (mean = 342.554, SD = 665.509). In addition, the outdegree and indegree presented similar mean values and the degree distributions of both district networks followed a power-law function. The network of live pigs at provincial level showed the highest value for betweenness (mean = 0.011, SD = 0.017), and the network of live pigs at provincial level showed the highest value for fragmentation (mean = 0.027, SD = 0.005). Our simulation data indicated that the disease occurred randomly due to live pig and carcass movements along the central and western regions of Thailand, causing the rapid spread of ASF. Without control measures, it could spread to all provinces within 5-and 3-time units and in all districts within 21-and 30-time units for the network of live pigs and carcasses, respectively. This study assists the authorities to plan control and preventive measures and limit economic losses caused by ASF.",2023,PEERJ,11,,,10.7717/peerj.15359,#125,Poolkhet 2023
"Network analysis of swine shipments in Ontario, Canada, to support disease spread modelling and risk-based disease management","Dorjee, S; Revie, CW; Poljak, Z; McNab, WB; Sanchez, J","Understanding contact networks are important for modelling and managing the spread and control of communicable diseases in populations. This study characterizes the swine shipment network of a multi-site production system in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Data were extracted from a company's database listing swine shipments among 251 swine farms, including 20 sow, 69 nursery and 162 finishing farms, for the 2-year period of 2006 to 2007. Several network metrics were generated. The number of shipments per week between pairs of farms ranged from 1 to 6. The medians (and ranges) of out-degree were: sow 6 (1-21), nursery 8(0-25), and finishing 0(0-4), over the entire 2-year study period. Corresponding estimates for in-degree of nursery and finishing farms were 3 (0-9) and 3 (0-12) respectively. Outgoing and incoming infection chains (OIC and IIC), were also measured. The medians (ranges) of the monthly OIC and IIC were 0 (0-8) and 0 (0-6), respectively, with very similar measures observed for 2-week intervals. Nursery farms exhibited high measures of centrality. This indicates that they pose greater risks of disease spread in the network. Therefore, they should be given a high priority for disease prevention and control measures affecting all age groups alike. The network demonstrated scale-free and small-world topologies as observed in other livestock shipment studies. This heterogeneity in contacts among farm types and network topologies should be incorporated in simulation models to improve their validity. In conclusion, this study provided useful epidemiological information and parameters for the control and modelling of disease spread among swine farms, for the first time from Ontario, Canada.

Relationship of trade patterns of the Danish swine industry animal movements network to potential disease spread,"Bigras-Poulin, M; Barfod, K; Mortensen, S; Greiner, M","The movements of animals were analysed under the conceptual framework of graph theory in mathematics. The swine production related premises of Denmark were considered to constitute the nodes of a network and the links were the animal movements. In this framework, each farm will have a network of other premises to which it will be linked. A premise was a farm (breeding, rearing or slaughter pig), an abattoir or a trade market. The overall network was divided in premise specific subnets that linked the other premises from and to which animals were moved. This approach allowed us to visualise and analyse the three levels of organization related to animal movements that existed in the Danish swine production registers: the movement of animals between two premises, the premise specific networks, and the industry network. The analyses of animal movements were done using these three levels of organisation.The movements of swine were studied for the period September 30, 2002 to May 22, 2003. For daily movements of swine between two slaughter pig premises, the median number of pigs moved was 130 pigs with a maximum of 3306. For movements between a slaughter pig premise and an abattoir, the median number of pigs was 24. The largest percentage of movements was from farm to abattoir (82.5%); the median number of pigs per movement was 24 and the maximum number was 2018. For the whole period the median and maximum Euclidean distances observed in farm-to-farm movements were 22 km and 289 km respectively, while in the farm-to-abattoir movements, they were 36.2 km and 285 km. The network related to one specific premise showed that the median number of premises was mainly away from slaughter pig farms (3) or breeder farms (26) and mainly to an abattoir (1535).The assumption that animal movements can be randomly generated on the basis of farm density of the surrounding area of any farm is not correct since the patterns of animal movements have the topology of a scale-free network with a large degree of heterogeneity. This supported the opinion that the disease spread software assuming homogeneity in farm-to-farm relationship should only be used for large-scale interpretation and for epidemic preparedness. The network approach, based on graph theory, can be used efficiently to express more precisely, on a local scale (premise), the heterogeneity of animal movements. This approach, by providing network knowledge to the local veterinarian in charge of controlling disease spread, should also be evaluated as a potential tool to manage epidemics during the crisis. Geographic information systems could also be linked in the approach to produce knowledge about local transmission of disease.

Structural vulnerability of the French swine industry trade network to the spread of infectious diseases,"Rautureau, S; Dufour, B; Durand, B","The networks generated by live animal movements are the principal vector for the propagation of infectious agents between farms, and their topology strongly affects how fast a disease may spread. The structural characteristics of networks may thus provide indicators of network vulnerability to the spread of infectious disease. This study applied social network analysis methods to describe the French swine trade network. Initial analysis involved calculating several parameters to characterize networks and then identifying high-risk subgroups of holdings for different time scales. Holding-specific centrality measurements ('degree', 'betweenness' and 'ingoing infection chain'), which summarize the place and the role of holdings in the network, were compared according to the production type. In addition, network components and communities, areas where connectedness is particularly high and could influence the speed and the extent of a disease, were identified and analysed. Dealer holdings stood out because of their high centrality values suggesting that these holdings may control the flow of animals in part of the network. Herds with growing units had higher values for degree and betweenness centrality, representing central positions for both spreading and receiving disease, whereas herds with finishing units had higher values for in-degree and ingoing infection chain centrality values and appeared more vulnerable with many contacts through live animal movements and thus at potentially higher risk for introduction of contagious diseases. This reflects the dynamics of the swine trade with downward movements along the production chain. But, the significant heterogeneity of farms with several production units did not reveal any particular type of production for targeting disease surveillance or control. Besides, no giant strong connected component was observed, the network being rather organized according to communities of small or medium size (<20% of network size). Because of this fragmentation, the swine trade network appeared less structurally vulnerable than ruminant trade networks. This fragmentation is explained by the hierarchical structure, which thus limits the structural vulnerability of the global trade network. However, inside communities, the hierarchical structure of the swine production system would favour the spread of an infectious agent (especially if introduced in breeding herds).",2012,ANIMAL,6,7,1152-1162,10.1017/S1751731111002631,#129,Rautureau 2012
Associations between attributes of live poultry trade and HPAI H5N1 outbreaks: a descriptive and network analysis study in northern Vietnam,"Magalhaes, RJS; Ortiz-Pelaez, A; Kim, LLT; Quoc, HD; Otte, J; Pfeiffer, DU","Background: The structure of contact between individuals plays an important role in the incursion and spread of contagious diseases in both human and animal populations. In the case of avian influenza, the movement of live birds is a well known risk factor for the geographic dissemination of the virus among poultry flocks. Live bird markets (LBM's) contribute to the epidemiology of avian influenza due to their demographic characteristics and the presence of HPAI H5N1 virus lineages. The relationship between poultry producers and live poultry traders (LPT's) that operate in LBM's has not been adequately documented in HPAI H5N1-affected SE Asian countries. The aims of this study were to document and study the flow of live poultry in a poultry trade network in northern Vietnam, and explore its potential role in the risk for HPAI H5N1 during 2003 to 2006.Results: Our results indicate that LPT's trading for less than a year and operating at retail markets are more likely to source poultry from flocks located in communes with a past history of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks during 2003 to 2006 than LPT's trading longer than a year and operating at wholesale markets. The results of the network analysis indicate that LPT's tend to link communes of similar infection status.Conclusions: Our study provides evidence which can be used for informing policies aimed at encouraging more biosecure practices of LPT's operating at authorised LBM's. The results suggest that LPT's play a role in HPAI H5N1 transmission and may contribute to perpetuating HPAI H5N1 virus circulation amongst certain groups of communes. The impact of current disease prevention and control interventions could be enhanced by disseminating information about outbreak risk and the implementation of a formal data recording scheme at LBM's for all incoming and outgoing LPT's.",2010,BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH,6,,,10.1186/1746-6148-6-10,#130,Magalhaes 2010
Using network analysis to identify seasonal patterns and key nodes for risk-based surveillance of pig diseases in Italy,"Crescio, MI; Mastrantonio, G; Bertolini, S; Maurella, C; Adkin, A; Ingravalle, F; Simons, RRL; DeNardi, M; Stark, K; Estrada-Peña, A; Ru, G","The description of the pattern of livestock movements between herds provides essential information for both improving risk-based surveillance and to understand the likely spread of infectious diseases. This study provides a description of the temporal pattern of pig movements recorded in Italy on a 4-year period (2013-2016). Data, provided by the National Livestock registry, were described by social network analysis and the application of a walk-trap algorithm for community detection. Our results show a highly populated community located in Northern Italy, which is the focal point of the Italian industrial pig production and as a general pattern an overall decline of medium and backyard farms and an increase in the number of large farms, in agreement with the trend observed by other EU pig-producing countries. A seasonal pattern of all the parameters evaluated, including the number of active nodes in both the intensive and smaller production systems, emerged: that is characterized by a higher number of movements in spring and autumn, linked with the breeding and production cycle as pigs moved from the growing to the finishing phase and with periods of increased slaughtering at Christmas and Easter. The same pattern was found when restricting the analysis to imported pig batches. Outbreaks occurring during these periods would have a greater impact on the spread of infectious diseases; therefore, targeted surveillance may be appropriate. Finally, potential super-spreader nodes have been identified and represent 0.47% of the total number of pig holdings (n = 477). Those nodes are present during the whole study period with a similar ranking in their potential of being super-spreaders. Most of them were in Northern Italy, but super-spreaders with high mean out-degree centrality were also located in other Regions. Seasonality, communities and super-spreaders should be considered when planning surveillance activity and when applying disease control strategies.",2021,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,68,6,3541-3551,10.1111/tbed.13960,#131,Crescio 2021
Automatic classification of farms and traders in the pig production chain,"Koeppel, L; Siems, T; Fischer, M; Lentz, HHK","The trade in live pigs is an essential risk factor in the spread of animal diseases. Traders play a key role in the trade network, as they are logistics hubs and responsible for large animal movements. In order to implement targeted control measures in case of a disease outbreak, it is hence strongly advisable to use information about the holding type in the pig production chain. However, in many datasets the types of the producing farms or the fact whether the agent is a trader are unknown.In this paper we introduce two indices that can be used to identify the position of a producing farm in the pig production chain and more importantly, identify traders. This was realized partially through a novel dynamic programming algorithm. Analyzing the pig trade network in Germany from 2005 to 2007, we demonstrate that our algorithm is very sensitive in detecting traders. Since the methodology can easily be applied to trade networks in other countries with similar infrastructure and legislation, we anticipate its use for augmenting the datasets in further network analyses and targeting control measures. For further usage, we have developed an R package which can be found in the supplementary material to this manuscript.",2018,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,150,,86-92,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.12.003,#132,Koeppel 2018
Global formal live poultry and hatching egg trade network (2004-2016): description and association with poultry disease reporting and presence,"Awada, L; Chalvet-Monfray, K; Tizzani, P; Caceres, P; Ducrot, C","As international trade constitutes one of the main spread pathways of diseases, a better understanding of the trade behaviors of countries will help identify strengths and areas for improvement in the approach of national authorities to controlling poultry diseases globally. Using data reported to the United Nations Comtrade and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) between 2004 and 2016 by 193 countries, we used a network analysis on trade data of poultry hatching eggs, live poultry of less than 185 g and live poultry of 185 g or more to determine that: 1) quantities traded between countries are substantial, and tend to increase (average increase of 800,000 poultry heads and 21,000 tons of hatching eggs each year equivalent to an increase by 2-fold in 17 yr); 2) the stability of the networks was low (a quarter to half of trade relationships maintained between 2 consecutive years) and the subnetworks favorable to the spread of diseases were in general consistent with regional clustering, trade exchanges being equally at intracontinental and intercontinental levels; 3) countries with highest number of partners were located in the same world regions for the 3 poultry networks -Americas and Europe for export (up to 107 partners) and Africa, Asia and Europe for import (up to 36 partners); 4) for live poultry, biggest exporting countries shared more poultry disease surveillance data, and reported more disease presence than others, which did not stop them from trading. Biggest importers reported less poultry disease surveillance data and reported more disease presence than others; and 5) the main structural and trend characteristics of the international trade networks were in general similar for the 3 networks.

Network analysis of pig movements in Argentina: Identification of key farms in the spread of infectious diseases and their biosecurity levels,"Alarcón, LV; Cipriotti, PA; Monterubbianessi, M; Perfumo, C; Mateu, E; Allepuz, A","This study uses network analysis to evaluate how swine movements in Argentina could contribute to disease spread. Movement data for the 2014-2017 period were obtained from Argentina's online livestock traceability registry and categorized as follows: animals of high genetic value sent to other farms, animals to or from markets, animals sent to finisher operations and slaughterhouse. A network analysis was carried out considering the first three movement types. First, descriptive, centrality and cohesion measures were calculated for each movement type and year. Next, to determine whether networks had a small-world topology, these were compared with the results from random Erdos-Renyi network simulations. Then, the basic reproductive number (R-0) of the genetic network, the group of farms with higher potential for disease spread standing at the top of the production chain, was calculated to identify farms acting as super-spreaders. Finally, their external biosecurity scores were evaluated. The genetic network in Argentina presented a scale-free and small-world topology. Thus, we estimate that disease spread would be fast, preferably to highly connected nodes and with little chances of being contained. Throughout the study, 31 farms were identified as super-spreaders in the genetic network for all years, while other 55 were super-spreaders at least once, from an average of 1,613 farms per year. Interestingly, removal of less than 5% of higher degree and betweenness farms resulted in a >90% reduction of R-0 indicating that few farms have a key role in disease spread. When biosecurity scores of the most relevant super-spreaders were examined, it was evident that many were at risk of introducing and disseminating new pathogens across the whole of Argentina's pig production network. These results highlight the usefulness of establishing targeted surveillance and intervention programmes, emphasizing the need for better biosecurity scores in Argentinean swine production units, especially in super-spreader farms.",2020,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,67,3,1152-1163,10.1111/tbed.13441,#134,Alarcón 2020
Characterization of swine movements in the United States and implications for disease control,"Kinsley, AC; Perez, AM; Craft, ME; Vanderwaal, KL","Understanding between-farm movement patterns is an essential component in developing effective surveillance and control programs in livestock populations. Quantitative knowledge on movement patterns is particularly important for the commercial swine industry, in which large numbers of pigs are frequently moved between farms. Here, we described the annual movement patterns between swine farms in three production systems of the United States and identified farms that may be targeted to increase the efficacy of infectious disease control strategies. Research results revealed a high amount of variability in movement patterns across production systems, indicating that quantities captured from one production system and applied to another may lead to invalid estimations of disease spread. Furthermore, we showed that targeting farms based on their mean infection potential, a metric that captured the temporal sequence of movements, substantially reduced the potential for transmission of an infectious pathogen in the contact network and performed consistently well across production systems. Specifically, we found that by targeting farms based on their mean infection potential, we could reduce the potential spread of an infectious pathogen by 80% when removing approximately 25% of farms in each of the production systems. Whereas other metrics, such as degree, required 26-35% of farms to be removed in two of the production systems to reach the same outcome; this outcome was not achievable in one of the production systems. Our results demonstrate the importance of fine-scale temporal movement data and the need for in-depth understanding of the contact structure in developing more efficient disease surveillance and response strategies in swine production systems.",2019,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,164,,9-Jan,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.01.001,#135,Kinsley 2019
Network analysis of cattle movements in Uruguay: Quantifying heterogeneity for risk-based disease surveillance and control,"VanderWaal, KL; Picasso, C; Enns, EA; Craft, ME; Alvarez, J; Fernandez, F; Gil, A; Perez, A; Wells, S","Movement of livestock between premises is one of the foremost factors contributing to the spread of infectious diseases of livestock. In part to address this issue, the origin and destination for all cattle movements in Uruguay are registered by law. This information has great potential to be used in assessing the risk of disease spread in the Uruguayan cattle population. Here, we analyze cattle movements from 2008 to 2013 using network analysis in order to, understand the flows of animals in the Uruguayan cattle industry and to identify targets for surveillance and control measures. Cattle movements were represented as seasonal and annual networks in which farms represented nodes and nodes were linked based on the frequency and quantity of cattle moved. At the farm level, the distribution of the number of unique farms each farm is connected to through outgoing and incoming movements, as well as the number of animals moved, was highly right-skewed; the majority of farms had few to no contacts, whereas the 10% most highly connected farms accounted for 72-83% of animals moved annually. This extreme level of heterogeneity in movement patterns indicates that some farms may be disproportionately important for pathogen spread. Different production types exhibited characteristic patterns of farm-level connectivity, with some types, such a dairies, showing consistently higher levels of centrality. In addition, the observed networks were characterized by lower levels of connectivity and higher levels of heterogeneity than random networks of the same size and density, both of which have major implications for disease dynamics and control strategies. This represents the first in-depth analysis of farm-level livestock movements within South America, and highlights the importance of collecting livestock movement data in order to understand the vulnerability of livestock trade networks to invasion by infectious diseases.

Identifying target areas for risk-based surveillance and control of transboundary animal diseases: a seasonal analysis of slaughter and live-trade cattle movements in Uganda,"González-Gordon, L; Porphyre, T; Muwonge, A; Nantima, N; Ademun, R; Ochwo, S; Mwiine, NF; Boden, L; Muhanguzi, D; Bronsvoort, BMD","Animal movements are a major driver for the spread of Transboundary Animal Diseases (TADs). These movements link populations that would otherwise be isolated and hence create opportunities for susceptible and infected individuals to meet. We used social network analysis to describe the seasonal network structure of cattle movements in Uganda and unravel critical network features that identify districts or sub-regions for targeted risk-based surveillance and intervention. We constructed weighted, directed networks based on 2019 between-district cattle movements using official livestock mobility data; the purpose of the movement ('slaughter' vs. 'live trade') was used to subset the network and capture the risks more reliably. Our results show that cattle trade can result in local and long-distance disease spread in Uganda. Seasonal variability appears to impact the structure of the network, with high heterogeneity of node and edge activity identified throughout the seasons. These observations mean that the structure of the live trade network can be exploited to target influential district hubs within the cattle corridor and peripheral areas in the south and west, which would result in rapid network fragmentation, reducing the contact structure-related trade risks. Similar exploitable features were observed for the slaughter network, where cattle traffic serves mainly slaughter hubs close to urban centres along the cattle corridor. Critically, analyses that target the complex livestock supply value chain offer a unique framework for understanding and quantifying risks for TADs such as Foot-and-Mouth disease in a land-locked country like Uganda. These findings can be used to inform the development of risk-based surveillance strategies and decision making on resource allocation. For instance, vaccine deployment, biosecurity enforcement and capacity building for stakeholders at the local community and across animal health services with the potential to limit the socio-economic impact of outbreaks, or indeed reduce their frequency.",2023,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,13,1,,10.1038/s41598-023-44518-4,#140,González-Gordon 2023
Generative models of network dynamics provide insight into the effects of trade on endemic livestock disease,"Knight, MA; White, PCL; Hutchings, MR; Davidson, RS; Marion, G","We develop and apply analytically tractable generative models of livestock movements at national scale. These go beyond current models through mechanistic modelling of heterogeneous trade partnership network dynamics and the trade events that occur on them. Linking resulting animal movements to disease transmission between farms yields analytical expressions for the basic reproduction number R-0. We show how these novel modelling tools enable systems approaches to disease control, using R-0 to explore impacts of changes in trading practices on between-farm prevalence levels. Using the Scottish cattle trade network as a case study, we show our approach captures critical complexities of real-world trade networks at the national scale for a broad range of endemic diseases. Changes in trading patterns that minimize disruption to business by maintaining in-flow of animals for each individual farm reduce R-0, with the largest reductions for diseases that are most challenging to eradicate. Incentivizing high-risk farms to adopt such changes exploits 'scale-free' properties of the system and is likely to be particularly effective in reducing national livestock disease burden and incursion risk. Encouragingly, gains made by such targeted modification of trade practices scale much more favourably than comparably targeted improvements to more commonly adopted farm-level biosecurity.",2021,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,8,3,,10.1098/rsos.201715,#143,Knight 2021
"Vulnerability of Animal Trade Networks to The Spread of Infectious Diseases: A Methodological Approach Applied to Evaluation and Emergency Control Strategies in Cattle, France, 2005","Rautureau, S; Dufour, B; Durand, B","P>Besides farming, trade of livestock is a major component of agricultural economy. However, the networks generated by live animal movements are the major support for the propagation of infectious agents between farms, and their structure strongly affects how fast a disease may spread. Structural characteristics may thus be indicators of network vulnerability to the spread of infectious disease. The method proposed here is based upon the analysis of specific subnetworks: the giant strongly connected components (GSCs). Their existence, size and geographic extent are used to assess network vulnerability. Their disappearance when targeted nodes are removed allows studying how network vulnerability may be controlled under emergency conditions. The method was applied to the cattle trade network in France, 2005. Giant strongly connected components were present and widely spread all over the country in yearly, monthly and weekly networks. Among several tested approaches, the most efficient way to make GSCs disappear was based on the ranking of nodes by decreasing betweenness centrality (the proportion of shortest paths between nodes on which a specific node lies). Giant strongly connected components disappearance was obtained after removal of < 1% of network nodes. Under emergency conditions, suspending animal trade activities in a small subset of holdings may thus allow to control the spread of an infectious disease through the animal trade network. Nodes representing markets and dealers were widely affected by these simulated control measures. This confirms their importance as 'hubs' for infectious diseases spread. Besides emergency conditions, specific sensitization and preventive measures should be dedicated to this population.",2011,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,58,2,110-120,10.1111/j.1865-1682.2010.01187.x,#144,Rautureau 2011
Patterns of calving and young stock movement in Ireland and their implications for BVD serosurveillance,"Tratalos, JA; Graham, DA; More, SJ","The Republic of Ireland has a national eradication programme for bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDv) based on tissue-tag testing of calves to identify persistently infected animals (PIs). It has been proposed that serological testing of a sample of home-bred young stock would be a more cost effective surveillance mechanism than continued tissue-tag testing in herds which have previously been found to be BVD-free. These animals would have to be at least 6 months of age to avoid interference from maternal antibodies in test results. To examine the potential practicality of this system, we identified birth profiles and movements of calves born in Ireland during 2014 and 2015. We found that birth profiles for both beef and dairy animals were more evenly distributed throughout the year than often assumed, which should be borne in mind when evaluating the suitability of a single round of serological testing in the autumn for every herd. A large amount of movement was identified, with approximately 43% of calves experiencing a move before they reached 10 months of age, including moves to another Irish herd, to a knackery, to export, or to slaughter. Approximately 19% of calves had moved to other breeding herds in Ireland within this period. There were distinct patterns according to movement type, month of birth and herd type. The majority of herds moved either all or none of their calves in the first 10 months of life. These results indicate that young stock serological testing is unlikely to be an appropriate surveillance mechanism for all BVDv-free herds, as (i) many herds would not be able to supply a large enough sample of suitably aged home-bred young stock at a single point in time and (ii) Pls which would have been picked up by tissue-tag testing soon after birth would have moved from their home herd, to infect other herds, before serological testing could be conducted.

Risk-based surveillance for avian influenza control along poultry market chains in South China: The value of social network analysis,"Martin, V; Zhou, XY; Marshall, E; Jia, BB; Guo, FS; FrancoDixon, MA; DeHaan, N; Pfeiffer, DU; Magalhaes, RJS; Gilbert, M","Over the past two decades, the poultry sector in China went through a phase of tremendous growth as well as rapid intensification and concentration. Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 was first detected in 1996 in Guangdong province, South China and started spreading throughout Asia in early 2004. Since then, control of the disease in China has relied heavily on wide-scale preventive vaccination combined with movement control, quarantine and stamping out. This strategy has been successful in drastically reducing the number of outbreaks during the past 5 years. However, HPAIV H5N1 is still circulating and is regularly isolated in traditional live bird markets (LBMs) where viral infection can persist, which represent a public health hazard for people visiting them. The use of social network analysis in combination with epidemiological surveillance in South China has identified areas where the success of current strategies for HPAI control in the poultry production sector may benefit from better knowledge of poultry trading patterns and the LBM network configuration as well as their capacity for maintaining HPAIV H5N1 infection. We produced a set of LBM network maps and estimated the associated risk of HPAIV H5N1 within LBMs and along poultry market chains, providing new insights into how live poultry trade and infection are intertwined. More specifically, our study provides evidence that several biosecurity factors such as daily cage cleaning, daily cage disinfection or manure processing contribute to a reduction in HPAIV H5N1 presence in LBMs. Of significant importance is that the results of our study also show the association between social network indicators and the presence of HPAIV H5N1 in specific network configurations such as the one represented by the counties of origin of the birds traded in LBMs. This new information could be used to develop more targeted and effective control interventions.

"Network analysis of swine movements in a multi-site pig production system in Iowa, USA","Passafaro, TL; Fernandes, AFA; Valente, BD; Williams, NH; Rosa, GJM","Pig production in the United States is based on multi-site systems in which pigs are transported between farms after the conclusion of each particular production phase. Although ground transportation is a critical component of the pork supply chain, it might constitute a potential route of infectious disease dissemination. Here, we used a time series network analysis to: (1) describe pig movement flow in a multi-site production system in Iowa, USA, (2) conduct percolation analysis to investigate network robustness to interventions for diseases with different transmissibility, and (3) assess the potential impact of each farm type on disease dissemination across the system. Movement reports from 2014-2016 were provided by Iowa Select Farms, Iowa Fall, IA. A total of 76,566 shipments across sites was analyzed, and time series network analyses with temporal resolution of 1, 3, 6, 12, and 36 months were considered. The general topological properties of networks with resolution of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were compared with the whole period static network (36 months) and included the following features: number of nodes and edges, degree assortativity, density, average path length, diameter, clustering coefficients, giant strongly connected component, giant weakly connected component, giant in component, and giant out component. Small-world and scale-free topologies, centrality parameters, and percolation analysis were investigated for the networks with 1-month window. Networks' robustness to interventions was assessed by using the Basic Reproduction Number (R-0). Centrality parameters indicate that gilt development units (GDU), nursery, and sow farms have more central role in the pig production hierarchical structure. Therefore, they are potentially major factors of introduction and spread of diseases over the system. Wean-to-finishing and finishing sites displayed high in-degree values, indicating that they are more susceptible to be infected. Percolation analysis combined with general properties (i.e. heavy-tailed distributions and degree disassortative) suggested that networks with 1-month time resolution were highly responsive to interventions. Furthermore, the characteristics of a disease should have strong implications in the biosecurity practices across production sites. For instance, biosecurity practices should be focused on sow farms for highly contagious disease (e.g., foot and mouth disease), while it should target nursery sites in the case of a less contagious diseases (i.e. mycobacterial infections). Understanding the patterns of swine movements is crucial for the swine industry decision-making in the case of an epidemic, as well as to design cost-effective approaches to monitor, prevent, control and eradicate infectious diseases in multi-site systems.",2020,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,174,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.104856,#148,Passafaro 2020
Controlling bovine paratuberculosis at a regional scale: Towards a decision modelling tool,"Beaunée, G; Vergu, E; Joly, A; Ezanno, P","Johne's disease (paratuberculosis), a worldwide enzootic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map), mainly introduced into farms by purchasing infected animals, has a large economic impact for dairy producers. Since diagnostic tests used in routine are poorly sensitive, observing Map spread in the field is hardly possible, whereas there is a need for evaluating control strategies. Our objective was to provide a modelling framework to compare the efficacy of regional control strategies combining internal biosecurity measures and testing of traded animals, against Map spread in a metapopulation of dairy cattle herds. We represented 12,857 dairy herds located in Brittany (France), based on data from 2005 to 2013, used to calibrate herd sizes and demographic rates and to define trade events in a multiscale model of Map infection dynamics. By clustering and categorical descriptive analysis of intensive simulations of this model, based on a numerical experimental design, a large panel of control measures was explored. Their efficacy was assessed on model outputs such as the prevalence and probability of extinction at the metapopulation level. In addition, we proposed a scoring for the effort required to implement control measures and prioritized control strategies based on their theoretical epidemiological efficacy. Our results clearly indicate that eradication cannot be achieved on the mid term using available control measures. However, we identified relevant combinations of measures that lead to the control of Map spread with realistic level of implementation and coverage. The study highlights the challenge of controlling paratuberculosis in an endemically infected region as related to the poor test characteristics and frequent trade movements. Our model lays the foundations for a flexible and efficient tool to help collective animal health managers in defining relevant control strategies at a regional scale, accounting for local specificities in terms of contact network and farms' characteristics.

Pig movements in France: Designing network models fitting the transmission route of pathogens,"Salines, M; Andraud, M; Rose, N","Pathogen spread between farms results from interaction between the epidemiological characteristics of infectious agents, such as transmission route, and the contact structure between holdings. The objective of our study was to design network models of pig movements matching with epidemiological features of pathogens. Our first model represents the transmission of infectious diseases between farms only through the introduction of animals to holdings (Animal Introduction Model AIM), whereas the second one also accounts for pathogen spread through intermediate transit of trucks through farms even without any animal unloading (i.e. indirect transmission - Transit Model TM). To take the pyramidal organisation of pig production into consideration, these networks were studied at three different scales: the whole network and two subnetworks containing only breeding or production farms. The two models were applied to pig movement data recorded in France from June 2012 to December 2014. For each type of model, we calculated network descriptive statistics, looked for weakly/strongly connected components (WCCs/SCCs) and communities, and analysed temporal patterns. Whatever the model, the network exhibited scale-free and small-world topologies. Differences in centrality values between the two models showed that nucleus, multiplication and post-weaning farms played a key role in the spread of diseases transmitted exclusively by the introduction of infected animals, whereas farrowing and farrow-to-finish herds appeared more vulnerable to the introduction of infectious diseases through indirect contacts. The second network was less fragmented than the first one, a giant SCC being detected. The topology of network communities also varied with modelling assumptions: in the first approach, a huge geographically dispersed community was found, whereas the second model highlighted several small geographically clustered communities. These results underline the relevance of developing network models corresponding to pathogen features (e.g. their transmission route), and the need to target specific types of holdings/areas for surveillance depending on the epidemiological context.",2017,PLOS ONE,12,10,,10.1371/journal.pone.0185858,#150,Salines 2017
"Descriptive network analysis and the influence of timescale on centrality and cohesion metrics from a system of between-herd dairy cow movements in Ontario, Canada","Comper, JR; Kelton, D; Hand, KJ; Poljak, Z; Greer, AL","Previous research has demonstrated that static monthly networks of between-herd dairy cow movements in Ontario, Canada were highly fragmented, reducing potential for large-scale outbreaks. Extrapolating results from static networks can become problematic for diseases with an incubation period that exceeds the timescale of the network. The objectives of this research were to: 1) describe the networks of dairy cow movements in Ontario, and 2) describe the changes that occur among network analysis metrics when conducted at seven different timescales. Networks of dairy cow movements were created using Lactanet Canada milk recording data collected in Ontario between 2009 and 2018. Centrality and cohesion metrics were calculated after aggregating the data at seven timescales: weekly, monthly, semi-annual, annual, biennial, quinquennial, and decennial. There were 50,598 individual cows moved between Lactanet-enrolled farms, representing approximately 75% of provincially registered dairy herds. Most movements occurred over short distances (median = 39.18 km), with fewer long-range movements (maximum = 1150.80 km). The number of arcs increased marginally relative to the number of nodes with longer network timescales. Both mean out-degree, and mean clustering coefficients increased disproportionately with increasing timescale. Conversely, mean network density decreased with increasing timescale. The largest weak and strong components at the monthly timescale were small relative to the full network (267 and 4 nodes), whereas yearly networks had much higher values (2213 and 111 nodes). Higher relative connectivity in networks with longer timescales suggests pathogens with long incubation periods and animals with subclinical infection present increased potential for wide-spread disease transmission among dairy farms in Ontario. Careful consideration of disease-specific dynamics should be made when using static networks to model disease transmission among dairy cow populations.",2023,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,213,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2023.105861,#151,Comper 2023
Using social network analysis to inform disease control interventions,"Marquetoux, N; Stevenson, MA; Wilson, P; Ridler, A; Heuer, C","Contact patterns between individuals are an important determinant for the spread of infectious diseases in populations. Social network analysis (SNA) describes contact patterns and thus indicates how infectious pathogens may be transmitted. Here we explore network characteristics that may inform the development of disease control programes.This study applies SNA methods to describe a livestock movement network of 180 farms in New Zealand from 2006 to 2010. We found that the number of contacts was overall consistent from year to year, while the choice of trading partners tended to vary. This livestock movement network illustrated how a small number of farms central to the network could play a potentially dominant role for the spread of infection in this population. However, fragmentation of the network could easily be achieved by ""removing"" a small proportion of farms serving as bridges between otherwise isolated clusters, thus decreasing the probability of large epidemics.This is the first example of a comprehensive analysis of pastoral livestock movements in New Zealand.

A 'what-if' scenario: Nipah virus attacks pig trade chains in Thailand,"Wongnak, P; Thanapongtharm, W; Kusakunniran, W; Karnjanapreechakorn, S; Sutassananon, K; Kalpravidh, W; Wongsathapornchai, K; Wiratsudakul, A","BackgroundNipah virus (NiV) is a fatal zoonotic agent that was first identified amongst pig farmers in Malaysia in 1998, in an outbreak that resulted in 105 fatal human cases. That epidemic arose from a chain of infection, initiating from bats to pigs, and which then spilled over from pigs to humans. In Thailand, bat-pig-human communities can be observed across the country, particularly in the central plain. The present study therefore aimed to identify high-risk areas for potential NiV outbreaks and to model how the virus is likely to spread. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and weighted linear combination (WLC) were employed to produce the NiV risk map. The map was then overlaid with the nationwide pig movement network to identify the index subdistricts in which NiV may emerge. Subsequently, susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) modeling was used to simulate NiV spread within each subdistrict, and network modeling was used to illustrate how the virus disperses across subdistricts.ResultsBased on the MCDA and pig movement data, 14 index subdistricts with a high-risk of NiV emergence were identified. We found in our infectious network modeling that the infected subdistricts clustered in, or close to the central plain, within a range of 171km from the source subdistricts. However, the virus may travel as far as 528.5km (R-0=5).ConclusionsIn conclusion, the risk of NiV dissemination through pig movement networks in Thailand is low but not negligible. The risk areas identified in our study can help the veterinary authority to allocate financial and human resources to where preventive strategies, such as pig farm regionalization, are required and to contain outbreaks in a timely fashion once they occur.",2020,BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH,16,1,,10.1186/s12917-020-02502-4,#153,Wongnak 2020

Despite an abundance of small-scale observational studies, the role of the poultry trade in disseminating AIV over large geographic areas is still unclear, especially for developing countries with complex poultry production systems. Here we combine virus genomes and reconstructed poultry transportation data to measure and compare the spatial spread in China of three key subtypes of AIV: H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6. Although it is difficult to disentangle the contribution of confounding factors, such as bird migration and spatial distance, we find evidence that the dissemination of these subtypes among domestic poultry is geographically continuous and likely associated with the intensity of the live poultry trade in China. Using two independent data sources and network analysis methods, we report a regional-scale community structure in China that might explain the spread of AIV subtypes in the country.

Modeling nation-wide US swine movement networks at the resolution of the individual premises,"Sellman, S; Beck-Johnson, LM; Hallman, C; Miller, RS; Bonner, KAO; Portacci, K; Webb, CT; Lindström, T","The spread of infectious livestock diseases is a major cause for concern in modern agricultural systems. In the dynamics of the transmission of such diseases, movements of livestock between herds play an important role. When constructing mathematical models used for activities such as forecasting epidemic development, evaluating mitigation strategies, or determining important targets for disease surveillance, including between -premises shipments is often a necessity. In the United States (U.S.), livestock shipment data is not routinely collected, and when it is, it is not readily available and mostly concerned with between-state shipments. To bridge this gap in knowledge and provide insight into the complete livestock shipment network structure, we have developed the U.S. Animal Movement Model (USAMM). Previously, USAMM has only existed for cattle shipments, but here we present a version for domestic swine. This new version of USAMM consists of a Bayesian model fit to premises demography, county-level livestock industry variables, and two limited data sets of between-state swine movements. The model scales up the data to simulate nation-wide networks of both within-and between-state shipments at the level of individual premises. Here we describe this shipment model in detail and subsequently explore its usefulness with a rudimentary predictive model of the prevalence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) across the U.S. Additionally, in order to promote further research on livestock disease and other topics involving the movements of swine in the U.S., we also make 250 synthetic premises-level swine shipment networks with complete coverage of the entire conterminous U.S. freely available to the research community as a useful surrogate for the absent shipment data.",2022,EPIDEMICS,41,,,10.1016/j.epidem.2022.100636,#157,Sellman 2022
Interventions for avian influenza A (H5N1) risk management in live bird market networks,"Fournie, G; Guitian, J; Desvaux, S; Cuong, VC; Dung, DH; Pfeiffer, DU; Mangtani, P; Ghani, AC","Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 is endemic in Asia, with live bird trade as a major disease transmission pathway. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in northern Vietnam to investigate the structure of the live bird market (LBM) contact network and the implications for virus spread. Based on the movements of traders between LBMs, weighted and directed networks were constructed and used for social network analysis and individual-based modeling. Most LBMs were connected to one another, suggesting that the LBM network may support large-scale disease spread. Because of cross-border trade, it also may promote transboundary virus circulation. However, opportunities for disease control do exist. The implementation of thorough, daily disinfection of the market environment as well as of traders' vehicles and equipment in only a small number of hubs can disconnect the network dramatically, preventing disease spread. These targeted interventions would be an effective alternative to the current policy of a complete ban of LBMs in some areas. Some LBMs that have been banned still are very active, and they likely have a substantial impact on disease dynamics, exhibiting the highest levels of susceptibility and infectiousness. The number of trader visits to markets, information that can be collected quickly and easily, may be used to identify LBMs suitable for implementing interventions. This would not require prior knowledge of the force of infection, for which laboratory-confirmed surveillance would be necessary.

Live bird markets characterization and trading network analysis in Mali: Implications for the surveillance and control of avian influenza and Newcastle disease,"Molia, S; Boly, IA; Duboz, R; Coulibaly, B; Guitian, J; Grosbois, V; Fournie, G; Pfeiffer, DU","Live bird markets (LBMs) play an important role in the transmission of avian influenza (Al) and Newcastle disease (ND) viruses in poultry. Our study had two objectives: (1) characterizing LBMs in Mali with a focus on practices influencing the risk of transmission of Al and ND, and (2) identifying which LBMs should be targeted for surveillance and control based on properties of the live poultry trade network. Two surveys were conducted in 2009-2010: a descriptive study in all 96 LBM5 of an area encompassing approximately 98% of the Malian poultry population and a network analysis study in Sikasso county, the main poultry supplying county for the capital city Bamako. Regarding LBMs' characteristics, risk factors for the presence of Al and ND viruses (being open every day, more than 2 days before a bird is sold, absence of zoning to segregate poultry-related work flow areas, waste removal or cleaning and disinfecting less frequently than on a daily basis, trash disposal of dead birds and absence of manure processing) were present in 80-100% of the LBMs. Furthermore, LBM5 tended to have wide catchment areas because of consumers' preference for village poultry meat, thereby involving a large number of villages in their supply chain. In the poultry trade network from/to Sikasso county, 182 traders were involved and 685 links were recorded among 159 locations. The network had a heterogeneous degree distribution and four hubs were identified based on measures of in-degrees, out-degrees and betweenness: the markets of Medine and Wayerma and the fairs of Farakala and Niena. These results can be used to design biosecurity-improvement interventions and to optimize the prevention, surveillance and control of transmissible poultry diseases in Malian LBMs. Further studies should investigate potential drivers (seasonality, prices) of the poultry trade network and the acceptability of biosecurity and behavior-change recommendations in the Malian socio-cultural context.

Quantifying the dynamics of pig movements improves targeted disease surveillance and control plans,"Machado, G; Galvis, JA; Lopes, FPN; Voges, J; Medeiros, AAR; Cardenas, NC","Tracking animal movements over time may fundamentally determine the success of disease control interventions. In commercial pig production growth stages determine animal transportation schedule, thus it generates time-varying contact networks showed to influence the dynamics of disease spread. In this study, we reconstructed pig networks of one Brazilian state from 2017 to 2018, comprising 351,519 movements and 48 million transported pigs. The static networks view did not capture time-respecting movement pathways. For this reason, we propose a time-dependent network approach. A susceptible-infected model was used to spread an epidemic over the pig network globally through the temporal between-farm networks, and locally by a stochastic model to account for within-farm dynamics. We propagated disease to calculate the cumulative contacts as a proxy of epidemic sizes and evaluate the impact of network-based disease control strategies in the absence of other intervention alternatives. The results show that targeting 1,000 farms ranked by degree would be sufficient and feasible to diminish disease spread considerably. Our modelling results indicated that independently from where initial infections were seeded (i.e. independent, commercial farms), the epidemic sizes and the number of farms needed to be targeted to effectively control disease spread were quite similar; indeed, this finding can be explained by the presence of contact among all pig operation types The proposed strategy limited the transmission the total number of secondarily infected farms to 29, over two simulated years. The identified 1,000 farms would benefit from enhanced biosecurity plans and improved targeted surveillance. Overall, the modelling framework provides a parsimonious solution for targeted disease surveillance when temporal movement data are available.",2021,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,68,3,1663-1675,10.1111/tbed.13841,#163,Machado 2021
Use of Network Analysis and Spread Models to Target Control Actions for Bovine Tuberculosis in a State from Brazil,"Cardenas, NC; Pozo, P; Lopes, FPN; Grisi, JHH; Alvarez, J","Livestock movements create complex dynamic interactions among premises that can be represented, interpreted, and used for epidemiological purposes. These movements are a very important part of the production chain but may also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases through the transfer of infected animals over large distances. Social network analysis (SNA) can be used to characterize cattle trade patterns and to identify highly connected premises that may act as hubs in the movement network, which could be subjected to targeted control measures in order to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases such as bovine tuberculosis (TB). Here, we analyzed data on cattle movement and slaughterhouse surveillance for detection of TB-like lesions (TLL) over the 2016-2018 period in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in Brazil with the following aims: (i) to characterize cattle trade describing the static full, yearly, and monthly snapshots of the network contact trade, (ii) to identify clusters in the space and contact networks of premises from which animals with TLL originated, and (iii) to evaluate the potential of targeted control actions to decrease TB spread in the cattle population of RS using a stochastic metapopulation disease transmission model that simulated within-farm and between-farm disease spread. We found heterogeneous densities of premises and animals in the study area. The analysis of the contact network revealed a highly connected (similar to 94%) trade network, with strong temporal trends, especially for May and November. The TLL cases were significantly clustered in space and in the contact network, suggesting the potential for both local (e.g., fence-to-fence) and movement-mediated TB transmission. According to the disease spread model, removing the top 7% connected farms based on degree and betweenness could reduce the total number of infected farms over three years by >50%. In conclusion, the characterization of the cattle network suggests that highly connected farms may play a role in TB dissemination, although being close to infected farms was also identified as a risk factor for having animals with TLL. Surveillance and control actions based on degree and betweenness could be useful to break the transmission cycle between premises in RS.",2021,MICROORGANISMS,9,2,,10.3390/microorganisms9020227,#166,Cardenas 2021
Analysing livestock network data for infectious disease control: an argument for routine data collection in emerging economies,"Chaters, GL; Johnson, PCD; Cleaveland, S; Crispell, J; de Glanville, WA; Doherty, T; Matthews, L; Mohr, S; Nyasebwa, OM; Rossi, G; Salvador, LCM; Swai, E; Kao, RR","Livestock movements are an important mechanism of infectious disease transmission. Where these are well recorded, network analysis tools have been used o successfully identify system properties, highlight vulnerabilities to transmission, and inform targeted surveillance and control. Here we highlight the main uses of network properties in understanding livestock disease epidemiology and discuss statistical approaches to infer network characteristics from 'biased or fragmented datasets. We use a 'hurdle model' approach that predicts (i) the probability of movement and (ii) the number of livestock moved to generate synthetic 'complete' networks of movements between administrative wards, exploiting routinely collected government movement permit data from northern Tanzania. We demonstrate that this model captures a significant amount of the observed variation. Combining the cattle movement network with a spatial between-ward contact layer, we create a multiplex, over which we simulated the spread of 'fast' (R-0 = 3) and 'slow' (R-0 = 1.5) pathogens, and assess the effects of random versus targeted disease control interventions (vaccination and movement ban). The targeted interventions substantially outperform those randomly implemented for both fast and slow pathogens. Our findings provide motivation to encourage routine collection and centralization of movement data to construct representative networks.This article is part of the theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease out-breaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control'.

The implementation of cattle market closure strategies to mitigate the foot-and-mouth disease epidemics: A contact modeling approach,"Wiratsudakul, A; Sekiguchi, S","Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most endemic diseases in livestock worldwide. The disease occurrence generally results in a huge economic impact. The virus may distribute across countries or even continents along the contact network of animal movements. The present study, therefore, aimed to explore a cattle movement network originated in Tak, a Thailand-Myanmar bordered province and to demonstrate how FMDV spread among the nodes of market, source and destination. Subsequently, we examined the effectiveness of market closure intervention. The market-market (M-M) network was constructed to highlight the inter-market connections and the FMDV was modeled to spread along the trade chain. Four market closure scenarios based on rapidness and duration of implementation were examined. Our results indicate that two of the three major markets located in the province were highly connected and a strongly connected component was identified. The intra-provincial animal movements, which were currently overlooked, should be moved into sights as most of the high-risk sources for FMD epidemics were recognized in a close proximity to the cattle markets. Simultaneously, remote destinations across the country were identified. The inter-provincial animal movement control must be strengthened once FMD outbreak is notified. Based on our simulations, closing markets with low inter-market connectivity may not prevent the spread of FMDV. A selective market closure strategy targeting highly connected markets together with cattle trader tracking system was an alternative approach. However, socio-economic consequences regarding this intervention must be considered.",2018,RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,121,,76-84,10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.10.007,#171,Wiratsudakul 2018
"Description and analysis of the poultry trading network in the Lake Alaotra region, Madagascar: Implications for the surveillance and control of Newcastle disease","Rasamoelina-Andriamanivo, H; Duboz, R; Lancelot, R; Maminiaina, OF; Jourdan, M; Rakotondramaro, TMC; Rakotonjanahary, SN; de Almeida, RS; Rakotondravao; Durand, B; Chevalier, V","Madagascar's 36.5-million-head poultry industry holds a foremost place in its economy and the livelihood of its people. Unfortunately, regular Newcastle disease outbreaks associated with high mortality causes high losses for smallholders and threatens their livelihood. Therefore, Madagascar is seeking concrete, achievable and sustainable methods for the surveillance and the control of Newcastle disease. In this paper, we present and analyze the results of a field study conducted in Madagascar between December 2009 and December 2010. The study area was the Lac Alaotra region, a landlocked area in the northeastern part of the country's center. Poultry trading is suspected of playing a major role in the spread of avian diseases, especially in developing countries characterized by many live-bird markets and middlemen. Therefore, the goals of our study were to: (i) describe and analyze smallholders' poultry trading network in the Lake Alaotra region using social network analysis; (ii) assess the role of the network in the spread of Newcastle disease; and (Hi) propose the implementation of a targeted disease surveillance based on the characteristics of the poultry trading network. We focused our field study on the harvesting of two data sets. The first is a complete description of the poultry trading network in the landlocked area of Lac Alaotra, including a description of the poultry movements between groups of villages. The second set of data measures the occurrence of outbreaks in the same area by combining a participatory approach with an event-based surveillance method. These data were used to determine the attributes of the network, and to statistically assess the association between the position of nodes and the occurrence of outbreaks. By using social network analysis techniques combined with a classification method and a logistic model, we finally identified 3 nodes (set of villages), of the 387 in the initial network, to focus on for surveillance and control in the Lac Alaotra area. This result is of primary importance in the ongoing efforts to effectively improve the wellbeing of people in the region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Role of animal movement and indirect contact among farms in transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,"VanderWaal, K; Perez, A; Torremorrell, M; Morrison, RM; Craft, M","Epidemiological models of the spread of pathogens in livestock populations primarily focus on direct contact between farms based on animal movement data, and in some cases, local spatial spread based on proximity between premises. The roles of other types of indirect contact among farms is rarely accounted for. In addition, data on animal movements is seldom available in the United States. However, the spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) in U.S. swine represents one of the best documented emergences of a highly infectious pathogen in the U.S. livestock industry, providing an opportunity to parameterize models of pathogen spread via direct and indirect transmission mechanisms in swine. Using observed data on pig movements during the initial phase of the PEDv epidemic, we developed a network-based and spatially explicit epidemiological model that simulates the spread of PEDv via both indirect and direct movement-related contact in order to answer unresolved questions concerning factors facilitating between-farm transmission. By modifying the likelihood of each transmission mechanism and fitting this model to observed epidemiological dynamics, our results suggest that between-farm transmission was primarily driven by direct mechanisms related to animal movement and indirect mechanisms related to local spatial spread based on geographic proximity. However, other forms of indirect transmission among farms, including contact via contaminated vehicles and feed, were responsible for high consequence transmission events resulting in the introduction of the virus into new geographic areas. This research is among the first reports of farm-level animal movements in the U.S. swine industry and, to our knowledge, represents the first epidemiological model of commercial U.S. swine using actual data on farm-level animal movement.",2018,EPIDEMICS,24,,67-75,10.1016/j.epidem.2018.04.001,#175,VanderWaal 2018
Development of a forecasting model for brucellosis spreading in the Italian cattle trade network aimed to prioritise the field interventions,"Savini, L; Candeloro, L; Conte, A; De Massis, F; Giovannini, A","Brucellosis caused by Brucella abortus is an important zoonosis that constitutes a serious hazard to public health. Prevention of human brucellosis depends on the control of the disease in animals. Livestock movement data represent a valuable source of information to understand the pattern of contacts between holdings, which may determine the inter-herds and intra-herd spread of the disease. The manuscript addresses the use of computational epidemic models rooted in the knowledge of cattle trade network to assess the probabilities of brucellosis spread and to design control strategies. Three different spread network-based models were proposed: the DFC (Disease Flow Centrality) model based only on temporal cattle network structure and unrelated to the epidemiological disease parameters; a deterministic SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model; a stochastic SEIR (SusceptibleExposed- Infectious-Recovered) model in which epidemiological and demographic within-farm aspects were also modelled. Containment strategies based on farms centrality in the cattle network were tested and discussed. All three models started from the identification of the entire sub-network originated from an infected farm, up to the fifth order of contacts. Their performances were based on data collected in Sicily in the framework of the national eradication plan of brucellosis in 2009. Results show that the proposed methods improves the efficacy and efficiency of the tracing activities in comparison to the procedure currently adopted by the veterinary services in the brucellosis control, in Italy. An overall assessment shows that the SIR model is the most suitable for the practical needs of the veterinary services, being the one with the highest sensitivity and the shortest computation time.",2017,PLOS ONE,12,6,,10.1371/journal.pone.0177313,#176,Savini 2017
"Spreading dynamics in a cattle trade network: Size, speed, typical profile and consequences on epidemic control strategies","Payen, A; Tabourier, L; Latapy, M","Infections can spread among livestock notably because infected animals can be brought to uncontaminated holdings, therefore exposing a new group of susceptible animals to the disease. As a consequence, the structure and dynamics of animal trade networks is a major focus of interest to control zoonosis. We investigate the impact of the chronology of animal trades on the dynamics of the process. Precisely, in the context of a basic SI model spreading, we measure on the French database of bovine transfers to what extent a snapshotbased analysis of the cattle trade networks overestimates the epidemic risks. We bring into light that an analysis taking into account the chronology of interactions would give a much more accurate assessment of both the size and speed of the process. For this purpose, we model data as a temporal network that we analyze using the link stream formalism in order to mix structural and temporal aspects. We also show that in this dataset, a basic SI spreading comes down in most cases to a simple two-phases scenario: a waiting period, with few contacts and low activity, followed by a linear growth of the number of infected holdings. Using this portrait of the spreading process, we identify efficient strategies to control a potential outbreak, based on the identification of specific elements of the link stream which have a higher probability to be involved in a spreading process.",2019,PLOS ONE,14,6,,10.1371/journal.pone.0217972,#177,Payen 2019
Controlling infectious disease through the targeted manipulation of contact network structure,"Gates, MC; Woolhouse, MEJ","Individuals in human and animal populations are linked through dynamic contact networks with characteristic structural features that drive the epidemiology of directly transmissible infectious diseases. Using animal movement data from the British cattle industry as an example, this analysis explores whether disease dynamics can be altered by placing targeted restrictions on contact formation to reconfigure network topology. This was accomplished using a simple network generation algorithm that combined configuration wiring with stochastic block modelling techniques to preserve the weighted in- and out-degree of individual nodes (farms) as well as key demographic characteristics of the individual network connections (movement date, livestock market, and animal production type). We then tested a control strategy based on introducing additional constraints into the network generation algorithm to prevent farms with a high in-degree from selling cattle to farms with a high out-degree as these particular network connections are predicted to have a disproportionately strong role in spreading disease. Results from simple dynamic disease simulation models predicted significantly lower endemic disease prevalences on the trade restricted networks compared to the baseline generated networks. As expected, the relative magnitude of the predicted changes in endemic prevalence was greater for diseases with short infectious periods and low transmission probabilities. Overall, our study findings demonstrate that there is significant potential for controlling multiple infectious diseases simultaneously by manipulating networks to have more epidemiologically favourable topological configurations. Further research is needed to determine whether the economic and social benefits of controlling disease can justify the costs of restricting contact formation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Combining value chain and social network analysis as a viable tool for informing targeted disease surveillance in the rural poultry sector of Zambia,"Mubamba, C; Ramsay, G; Abolnik, C; Dautu, G; Gummow, B","Diseases are among the greatest challenges to the rural poultry sector in sub-Saharan Africa. The lack of a sustainable poultry disease surveillance system and the possible existence of communities and occasions where the interaction between birds is high present an opportunity for targeted surveillance of poultry diseases in these regions. However, the establishment of such a system requires adequate knowledge of the sector in the targeted area. Zambia is an example of a developing country located in the tropics that faces the challenge of frequent poultry disease outbreaks. Consequently, an interview-based survey to study the poultry sector's market chain and social networks was conducted in Eastern Zambia to derive information required for configuring targeted surveillance. This survey involved a poultry value chain analysis that also included an assessment of trading practices to identify biosecurity hot spots within the chain that could be targeted for disease surveillance. A social network analysis of poultry movement within Eastern Zambia was also conducted using whole-network analysis and ego network analysis to identify poultry trade hubs that could be targeted for poultry disease surveillance based on their centrality within the network and their size and influence within their ego networks. Rural farmers, middlemen and market traders were identified as biosecurity risk hot spots whose poultry and utensils could be targeted for disease surveillance within the value chain. Furthermore, social network analysis identified four districts as poultry trade hubs that could be targeted for disease surveillance. This study is the first to formally describe poultry movement networks within Zambia and the surrounding region. Its findings provide data required to implement targeted surveillance in regions where resources are either inadequate or non-existent, and the results provide a deeper understanding of the cultural and practical constraints that influence trade in developing countries.",2018,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,65,6,1786-1796,10.1111/tbed.12953,#179,Mubamba 2018
A descriptive analysis of swine movements in Ontario (Canada) as a contributor to disease spread,"Melmer, DJ; O'Sullivan, TL; Poljak, Z","In recent times, considerable efforts have been made to develop infrastructure and processes of tracing livestock movements. One of common use of this type of data is to assess the potential for spread of infections in source populations. The objectives of this research were to describe Ontario pig movements in 2015, and to understand the potential for disease transmission through animal movement on a weekly and yearly basis. Swine shipments from January to December 2015 represented 224 production facilities and a total of 5398 unique animal movements. This one-mode directed network of animal movements was then analyzed using common descriptive network measures.The maximum yearly ((y)) weak component (WCy) size and maximum weekly ((w)) weak component size (WCw) was 224 facilities, and 83 facilities, respectively. The maximum WCw did not change significantly (p > 0.05) over time. The maximum strong component (SC) consisted of two facilities both on a weekly, and on a yearly basis. The size of the maximum ingoing contact chain on a yearly basis (ICCy) was 173 nodes with one abattoir as the end point, and the maximum ICCw consisted of 53 nodes. The size of the maximum outgoing contact chain (OCCy) contained 79 nodes, with one sow herd as a starting point. The maximum OCCw was 6 nodes. Regression models resulted in significant quadratic associations between weekly count of finisher facilities with betweenness > 0 (p = 0.02) and weekly count of finisher facilities with in-degree and out-degree > 0 (p = 0.01) and week number. Higher weekly counts of nursery and finisher facilities with betweenness > 0 and in-degree and out-degree both > 0 values occurred during summer months.All study facilities were connected when direction of animal movement was not taken into consideration in the yearly network. As such, yearly networks are potentially representative of infections with long incubation periods, subclinical infections, or endemic infections for which active control measures have not being taken. When the direction of animal movement was considered, such infection could still spread substantially and affect 35% of the study population (79/224).In the study population, finisher sites were proportionally and consistently most represented in WCw (min = 51%, max = 78%), which reflects current Ontario herd demographics. However, abattoirs were over-represented when the number of facilities in the study population was taken into consideration. This, and the size of the maximum ICCw both suggest that abattoirs could be, at least for some infectious diseases, suitable establishments for targeted sampling.",2018,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,159,,211-219,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.09.021,#181,Melmer 2018
Manipulation of contact network structure and the impact on foot-and-mouth disease transmission,"Mohr, S; Deason, M; Churakov, M; Doherty, T; Kao, RR","The movements of livestock between premises and markets can be characterised as a dynamic network where the structure of the network itself can critically impact the transmission dynamics of many infectious diseases. As evidenced by the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in the UK, this can involve transmission over large geographical distances and can result in major economic loss. One consequence of the FMD epidemic was the introduction of mandatory livestock movement restrictions: a 13-day standstill in Scotland for cattle and sheep after moving livestock onto a farm (allowing many exemptions) and a 6-day standstill for cattle and sheep in England and Wales (with minor exemptions, e.g. direct movements to slaughter). Such standstills are known to be effective but commercial considerations result in pressures to relax them. When contemplating legislative changes such as a change in length of movement restrictions we need to consider the consequent effect these could have on the emergent properties of the system, i.e. the network structure itself. In this study, we investigate how disease dynamics change when the local contact structure of the recorded livestock movement network in Scotland is altered through rewiring movements between premises. The network rewiring used here changes the structure of the recorded trade network through a combination of altered movement restrictions and redirection of movements between holdings and markets to avoid nonsensical activity (e.g. movements to markets on days when they are inactive) while conserving other characteristics (e.g. movement date as closely as possible and market sales of the correct animal production type). Rewiring results in networks with higher clustering coefficients and lower network density. The impact of rewiring on a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Scotland was assessed by stochastic simulation, considering scenarios with and without exemptions to the standstill rules. As expected, rewiring leads to a decrease in outbreak size and - if standstill exemptions are prohibited - higher probability of smaller outbreaks. Without exemptions, a shorter movement standstill is almost as effective as a longer standstill period, indicating that a simpler biosecurity system would offer minimal additional risk for FMD. These results suggest that explicitly manipulating the contact network structure in a sensible way has the potential to significantly impact disease control.",2018,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,157,,18-Aug,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.05.006,#183,Mohr 2018
Live Poultry Trade in Southern China Provinces and HPAIV H5N1 Infection in Humans and Poultry: The Role of Chinese New Year Festivities,"Magalhaes, RJS; Zhou, XY; Jia, BB; Guo, FS; Pfeiffer, DU; Martin, V","Background: The number of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H5N1 subtype (HPAIV H5N1) over the past 5 years has been drastically reduced in China but sporadic infections in poultry and humans are still occurring. In this study, we aimed to investigate seasonal patterns in the association between the movement of live poultry originating from southern China and HPAIV H5N1 infection history in humans and poultry in China.Methodology/Principal Findings: During January to April 2010, longitudinal questionnaire surveys were carried out monthly in four wholesale live bird markets (LBMs) in Hunan and Guangxi provinces of South China. Using social network analysis, we found an increase in the number of observed links and degree centrality between LBMs and poultry sources in February and March compared to the months of January and April. The association of some live poultry traders (LPT's) with a limited set of counties (within the catchment area of LBMs) in the months of February and March may support HPAIV H5N1 transmission and contribute to perpetuating HPAIV H5N1 virus circulation among certain groups of counties. The connectivity among counties experiencing human infection was significantly higher compared to counties without human infection for the months of January, March and April. Conversely, counties with poultry infections were found to be significantly less connected than counties without poultry infection for the month of February.Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that temporal variation in live poultry trade in Southern China around the Chinese New Year festivities is associated with higher HPAIV H5N1 infection risk in humans and poultry. This study has shown that capturing the dynamic nature of poultry trade networks in Southern China improves our ability to explain the spatiotemporal dissemination in avian influenza viruses in China.",2012,PLOS ONE,7,11,,10.1371/journal.pone.0049712,#185,Magalhaes 2012
Application of network analysis and cluster analysis for better prevention and control of swine diseases in Argentina,"Baron, JN; Aznar, MN; Monterubbianesi, M; Martínez-López, B","Rationale/background Though much smaller than the bovine industry, the porcine sector in Argentina involves a large number of farms and represents a significant economic sector. In recent years Argentina has implemented a national registry of swine movements amongst other measures, in an effort to control and eventually eradicate endemic Aujesky's disease. Such information can prove valuable in assessing the risk of transmission between farms for endemic diseases but also for other diseases at risk of emergence. Methods Shipment data from 2011 to 2016 were analyzed in an effort to define strategic locations and times at which control and surveillance efforts should be focused to provide cost-effective interventions. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to characterize the network as a whole and at the individual farm and market level to help identify important nodes. Spatio-temporal trends of pig movements were also analyzed. Finally, in an attempt to classify farms and markets in different groups based on their SNA metrics, we used factor analysis for mixed data (FAMD) and hierarchical clustering. Results The network involved approximate 136,000 shipments for a total of 6 million pigs. Over 350 markets and 17,800 production units participated in shipments with another 83,500 not participating. Temporal data of shipments and network metrics showed peaks in shipments in September and October. Most shipments where within provinces, with Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe concentrating 61% of shipments. Network analysis showed that markets are involved in relatively few shipments but hold strategic positions with much higher betweenness compared to farms. Hierarchical clustering yielded four groups based on SNA metrics and node characteristics which can be broadly described as: 1. small and backyard farms; 2. industrial farms; 3. markets; and 4. a single outlying market with extreme centrality values. Conclusion Characterizing the network structure and spatio-temporal characteristics of Argentine swine shipments provides valuable information that can guide targeted and more cost-effective surveillance and control programs. We located key nodes where efforts should be prioritized. Pig network characteristics and patterns can be used to create dynamic disease transmission models, which can both be used in assessing the impact of emerging diseases and guiding efforts to eradicate endemic ones.",2020,PLOS ONE,15,6,,10.1371/journal.pone.0234489,#186,Baron 2020
Optimizing surveillance for livestock disease spreading through animal movements,"Bajardi, P; Barrat, A; Savini, L; Colizza, V","The spatial propagation of many livestock infectious diseases critically depends on the animal movements among premises; so the knowledge of movement data may help us to detect, manage and control an outbreak. The identification of robust spreading features of the system is however hampered by the temporal dimension characterizing population interactions through movements. Traditional centrality measures do not provide relevant information as results strongly fluctuate in time and outbreak properties heavily depend on geotemporal initial conditions. By focusing on the case study of cattle displacements in Italy, we aim at characterizing livestock epidemics in terms of robust features useful for planning and control, to deal with temporal fluctuations, sensitivity to initial conditions and missing information during an outbreak. Through spatial disease simulations, we detect spreading paths that are stable across different initial conditions, allowing the clustering of the seeds and reducing the epidemic variability. Paths also allow us to identify premises, called sentinels, having a large probability of being infected and providing critical information on the outbreak origin, as encoded in the clusters. This novel procedure provides a general framework that can be applied to specific diseases, for aiding risk assessment analysis and informing the design of optimal surveillance systems.",2012,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE,9,76,2814-2825,10.1098/rsif.2012.0289,#189,Bajardi 2012
"Using multiple data sources to explore disease transmission risk between commercial poultry, backyard poultry, and wild birds in New Zealand","Greening, SS; Rawdon, TG; Mulqueen, K; French, NP; Gates, MC","The movements of backyard poultry and wild bird populations are known to pose a disease risk to the commercial poultry industry. However, it is often difficult to estimate this risk due to the lack of accurate data on the numbers, locations, and movement patterns of these populations. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the use of three different data sources when investigating disease transmission risk between poultry populations in New Zealand including (1) cross-sectional survey data looking at the movement of goods and services within the commercial poultry industry, (2) backyard poultry sales data from the online auction site TradeMe?, and (3) citizen science data from the wild bird monitoring project eBird.The cross-sectional survey data and backyard poultry sales data were transformed into network graphs showing the connectivity of commercial and backyard poultry producers across different geographical regions. The backyard poultry network was also used to parameterise a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) simulation model to explore the behaviour of potential disease outbreaks. The citizen science data was used to create an additional map showing the spatial distribution of wild bird observations across New Zealand. To explore the potential for diseases to spread between each population, maps were combined into bivariate choropleth maps showing the overlap between movements within the commercial poultry industry, backyard poultry trades and, wild bird observations.Network analysis revealed that the commercial poultry network was highly connected with geographical clustering around the urban centres of Auckland, New Plymouth and Christchurch. The backyard poultry network was also a highly active trade network and displayed similar geographic clustering to the commercial network. In the disease simulation models, the high connectivity resulted in all suburbs becoming infected in 96.4 % of the SI simulations. Analysis of the eBird data included reports of over 80 species; the majority of which were identified as coastal seabirds or wading birds that showed little overlap with either backyard or commercial poultry.Overall, our study findings highlight how the spatial patterns of trading activity within the commercial poultry industry, alongside the movement of backyard poultry and wild birds, have the potential to contribute significantly to the spread of diseases between these populations. However, it is clear that in order to fully understand this risk landscape, further data integration is needed; including the use of additional datasets that have further information on critical variables such as environmental factors.",2021,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,190,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105327,#191,Greening 2021
"Using value chain and trade networks in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, as a basis for targeted rural chicken surveillance","Simbizi, V; Moerane, R; Ramsay, G; Mubamba, C; Abolnik, C; Gummow, B","Despite the benefits of rural chickens in the Eastern Cape Province (ECP) of South Africa, this sector is still underdeveloped and poorly surveyed for poultry diseases. The lack of a sustainable poultry disease surveillance system coupled with communities and practices where the interactions between birds are high, emphasize the need for targeted surveillance of chicken diseases in the province. However, to set up such a system requires knowledge of the value chain and trade networks. Consequently, a survey, which involved a rural chicken value chain analysis that also included an assessment of trading practices to identify biosecurity hotspots and an identification of barriers to market entry for rural farmers was conducted. Secondly, a social network analysis of chicken movements in the province was carried out to identify trade hubs that could be targeted for disease surveillance based on their centrality within the network and their size and influence within their ego networks. Traders and their transport vehicles were identified as biosecurity hotspots that could be targeted for disease surveillance within the chain. Social network analysis identified three municipalities viz. Umzimvubu, King Sabata Dalindyebo (KSD) and Enoch Mgijima as trade hubs where interaction between rural chickens occurs and resources can be focused. The movement of spent hens from commercial operations that are transported over long distances and distributed in the rural areas and townships were a major risk for spread of poultry diseases. This is the first study to formally describe chicken trade networks within the province and the surrounding region. Its findings provide a model for cost effective targeted surveillance in the ECP and similar resource poor regions of the world. The study also provides insight into the profitability of rural chickens and a possible contribution to job creation and poverty alleviation once the barriers to market entry are lifted.",2022,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,207,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105713,#192,Simbizi 2022
Temporal stability of swine movement networks in the US,"Makau, DN; Paploski, IAD; VanderWaal, K","As a consequence of multi-site pig production practiced in North America, frequent and widespread animal movements create extensive networks of interaction between farms. Social network analysis (SNA) has been used to understand disease transmission risks within these complex and dynamic production ecosystems and is particularly relevant for designing risk-based surveillance and control strategies targeting highly connected farms. However, inferences from SNA and the effectiveness of targeted strategies may be influenced by temporal changes in network structure. Since farm movements represent a temporally dynamic network, it is also unclear how many months of data are required to gain an accurate picture of an individual farm's connectivity pattern and the overall network structure. The extent to which shipments between two specific farms are repeated (i.e., ""loyalty"" of farm contacts) can influence the rate at which the structure of a network changes over time, which may influence disease dynamics. In this study, we aimed to describe temporal stability and loyalty patterns of pig movement networks in the U.S. swine industry.We analyzed a total of 282,807 animal movements among 2724 farms belonging to two production systems between 2014 and 2017. Loyalty trends were largely driven by contacts between sow farms and nurseries and between nurseries and finisher farms; mean loyalty (percent of contacts that were repeated at least once within a 52-week interval) of farm contacts was 51-60 % for farm contacts involving weaned pigs, and 12-22% for contacts involving feeder pigs. A cyclic pattern was observed for both weaned and feeder pig movements, with episodes of increased loyalty observed at intervals of 8 and 17-20 weeks, respectively. Network stability was achieved when six months of data were aggregated, and only small shifts in node-level and global network metrics were observed when adding more data. This stability is relevant for designing targeted surveillance programs for disease management, given that movements summarized over too short a period may lead to stochastic swings in network metrics. A temporal resolution of six months would be reliable for the identification of potential super-spreaders in a network for targeted intervention and disease control. The temporal stability observed in these networks suggests that identifying highly connected farms in retrospective network data (up to 24 months) is reliable for future planning, albeit with reduced effectiveness.",2021,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,191,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105369,#193,Makau 2021
Descriptive and social network analysis of pig transport data recorded by quality assured pig farms in the UK,"Smith, RP; Cook, AJC; Christley, RM","The aim of this study was to examine farm-to-farm pig movement connections, and the usage of hauliers and abattoirs, for farms in the United Kingdom (UK), to determine the interconnectivity of the pig farm network and the implications this may have for the transmission and control of Salmonella, which was chosen as an example of an important endemic disease. Data were collected from three Quality Assurance Schemes on the use of abattoirs and livestock hauliers by commercial pig farms, and the supply of pigs to and from farms.The observed dataset had considerable variability in the number of direct (farm-to-farm) and indirect (via hauliers or abattoirs) connections between each farm over a 12-month period. The use of multiple hauliers and abattoirs by many farms resulted in considerable interconnectivity between farms due to these indirect routes. The network displayed a higher level of clustering, and short network distances between farms, than that shown by equivalent randomly generated datasets, indicating that infectious diseases might transmit quickly amongst farms but within certain clusters of farms, thus limiting the total number of farms affected. This structure and the occurrence of multiple indirect routes between many pairs of farms (via pig movements to other interconnected farms or from hauliers used by both farms), may indicate that targeting surveillance and controls on those farms with high network centrality characteristics (degree, betweenness) alone would not prove effective. Encouraging all farms within the network to reduce the number of connections might be a useful way of reducing Salmonella prevalence as it would reduce the effect of high prevalence on other farms within the network. The analysis also highlighted differences in the connections between geographical regions that were used to discuss the comparatively low Salmonella prevalence in Scotland detected by previous studies.Farms identified as belonging to large companies, as categorised by our analysis, were shown to mostly have movement connections within that company. However, small company farms had connections to farms belonging to large companies or other small companies, demonstrating that they may play an important role in creating links between large companies. The majority of farms in both Scotland and North-East and Eastern England belonged to large companies, and this finding is discussed in relation to how this may help explain the lower Salmonella seroprevalence in these areas.The study provides a first description of the characteristics of the UK pig movement network and the analysis has indicated a number of findings that might have implications for disease transmission and targeting surveillance and control.

Quantitative Risk Assessment for the Introduction of Bovine Leukemia Virus-Infected Cattle Using a Cattle Movement Network Analysis,"Notsu, K; Wiratsudakul, A; Mitoma, S; El Daous, H; Kaneko, C; El-Khaiat, HM; Norimine, J; Sekiguchi, S","The cattle industry is suffering economic losses caused by bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), the clinical condition associated with BLV infection. This pathogen spreads easily without detection by farmers and veterinarians due to the lack of obvious clinical signs. Cattle movement strongly contributes to the inter-farm transmission of BLV. This study quantified the farm-level risk of BLV introduction using a cattle movement analysis. A generalized linear mixed model predicting the proportion of BLV-infected cattle was constructed based on weighted in-degree centrality. Our results suggest a positive association between weighted in-degree centrality and the estimated number of introduced BLV-infected cattle. Remarkably, the introduction of approximately six cattle allowed at least one BLV-infected animal to be added to the farm in the worst-case scenario. These data suggest a high risk of BLV infection on farms with a high number of cattle being introduced. Our findings indicate the need to strengthen BLV control strategies, especially along the chain of cattle movement.",2020,PATHOGENS,9,11,,10.3390/pathogens9110903,#195,Notsu 2020
Multilayer and Multiplex Networks: An Introduction to Their Use in Veterinary Epidemiology,"Kinsley, AC; Rossi, G; Silk, MJ; VanderWaal, K","Contact network analysis has become a vital tool for conceptualizing the spread of pathogens in animal populations and is particularly useful for understanding the implications of heterogeneity in contact patterns for transmission. However, the transmission of most pathogens cannot be simplified to a single mode of transmission and, thus, a single definition of contact. In addition, host-pathogen interactions occur in a community context, with many pathogens infecting multiple host species and most hosts being infected by multiple pathogens. Multilayer networks provide a formal framework for researching host-pathogen systems in which multiple types of transmission-relevant interactions, defined as network layers, can be analyzed jointly. Here, we provide an overview of multilayer network analysis and review applications of this novel method to epidemiological research questions. We then demonstrate the use of this technique to analyze heterogeneity in direct and indirect contact patterns amongst swine farms in the United States. When contact among nodes can be defined in multiple ways, a multilayer approach can advance our ability to use networks in epidemiological research by providing an improved approach for defining epidemiologically relevant groups of interacting nodes and changing the way we identify epidemiologically important individuals such as superspreaders.",2020,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,7,,,10.3389/fvets.2020.00596,#198,Kinsley 2020
Disentangling transport movement patterns of trucks either transporting pigs or while empty within a swine production system before and during the COVID-19 epidemic,"Picasso-Risso, C; Vilalta, C; Sanhueza, JM; Kikuti, M; Schwartz, M; Corzo, CA","Transport of pigs between sites occurs frequently as part of genetic improvement and age segregation. However, a lack of transport biosecurity could have catastrophic implications if not managed properly as disease spread would be imminent. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive study of vehicle movement trends within swine systems in the Midwest. In this study, we aimed to describe and characterize vehicle movement patterns within one large Midwest swine system representative of modern pig production to understand movement trends and proxies for biosecurity compliance and identify potential risky behaviors that may result in a higher risk for infectious disease spread. Geolocation tracking devices recorded vehicle movements of a subset of trucks and trailers from a production system every 5 min and every time tracks entered a landmark between January 2019 and December 2020, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We described 6,213 transport records from 12 vehicles controlled by the company. In total, 114 predefined landmarks were included during the study period, representing 5 categories of farms and truck wash facilities. The results showed that trucks completed the majority (76.4%, 2,111/2,762) of the recorded movements. The seasonal distribution of incoming movements was similar across years (P > 0.05), while the 2019 winter and summer seasons showed higher incoming movements to sow farms than any other season, year, or production type (P < 0.05). More than half of the in-movements recorded occurred within the triad of sow farms, wean-to-market stage, and truck wash facilities. Overall, time spent at each landmark was 9.08% higher in 2020 than in 2019, without seasonal highlights, but with a notably higher time spent at truck wash facilities than any other type of landmark. Network analyses showed high connectivity among farms with identifiable clusters in the network. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in connectivity in 2020 compared with 2019, as indicated by the majority of network parameter values. Further network analysis will be needed to understand its impact on disease spread and control.

Using national movement databases to help inform responses to swine disease outbreaks in Scotland: the impact of uncertainty around incursion time,"Porphyre, T; Boden, LA; Correia-Gomes, C; Auty, HK; Gunn, GJ; Woolhouse, MEJ","Modelling is an important component of contingency planning and control of disease outbreaks. Dynamic network models are considered more useful than static models because they capture important dynamic patterns of farm behaviour as evidenced through animal movements.

It explores the utility and limitations of animal movement data to inform such models and as such, provides some insight into the impact of improving traceability through real-time animal movement reporting and the use of electronic animal movement databases.

Network Analysis of Swine Shipments in China: The First Step to Inform Disease Surveillance and Risk Mitigation Strategies,"O'Hara, K; Zhang, R; Jung, YS; Zhou, XB; Qian, YJ; Martínez-López, B","China's pork industry has been dramatically changing in the last few years. Pork imports are increasing, and small-scale farms are being consolidated into large-scale multi-site facilities. These industry changes increase the need for traceability and science-based decisions around disease monitoring, surveillance, risk mitigation, and outbreak response. This study evaluated the network structure and dynamics of a typical large-scale multi-site swine facility in China, as well as the implications for disease spread using network-based metrics. Forward reachability paths were used to demonstrate the extent of epidemic spread under variable site and temporal disease introductions. Swine movements were found to be seasonal, with more movements at the beginning of the year, and fewer movements of larger pigs later in the year. The network was highly egocentric, with those farms within the evaluated production system demonstrating high connectivity. Those farms which would contribute the highest epidemic potential were identified. Among these, different farms contributed to higher expected epidemic spread at different times of the year. Using these approaches, increased availability of swine movement networks in China could help to identify priority locations for surveillance and risk mitigation for both endemic problems and transboundary diseases such as the recently introduced, and rapidly spreading, African swine fever virus.",2020,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,7,,,10.3389/fvets.2020.00189,#203,O'Hara 2020
"Characterization and influencing factors of the pig movement network in Hunan Province, China","Shi, F; Huang, BX; Shen, CJ; Liu, Y; Liu, XX; Fan, ZX; Mubarik, S; Yu, CAH; Sun, XD","In terms of pig production in China, Hunan was the third largest province where the number of hogs accounted for 9.0 % of the national number of hogs in 2017. To propose the precise strategy for supervision of pig movements in Hunan Province, a weighted directed one-mode network was constructed using the data from the electronic animal health certificate platform in 2017. The nodes were designed as districts in Hunan and edges as flows of pig movement between districts. Social network analysis was used to analyse network characteristics and generalized linear models were performed to ascertain the socioeconomic factors that affect the pig movement network. During 2017, the pig movement network within the Hunan Province was composed of 122 nodes and 8562 directed connections, with a total of 510,973 shipments and 17,815,040 pigs moved. The network displayed a small-world topology, which had a higher clustering coefficient (0.4 vs. 0.1) and shorter average shortest path length (1.8 vs. 3.7) compared with equivalent random networks. The degree centrality positively correlated with closeness centrality (r = 0.99, P < 0.001) as well as betweenness centrality (r = 0.91, P < 0.001). After restricting the cross-regional pig movements in areas with the top 10 % of degree centrality, the number of pigs was reduced by nearly 50 % in the network, whereas the number of pigs was reduced by 94.0 % when movement restrictions were implemented in areas with the top 50 % of degree centrality. Observed network metrics showed an upward trend during the months of 2017, peaking in November and December. Generalized linear models showed that the size of the human population and per capita gross domestic product were the most important socioeconomic drivers of pig movements. The pig movement network in Hunan Province is a small-world network in which the introduction and spread of diseases may be quicker. More human, material, and financial resources should be allocated to areas with higher centrality. Swine movements were seasonal, and the inspection and quarantine work should be reinforced in the fourth quarter, especially in November and December. Pig movements were more active in areas with larger populations and advanced economy, and stricter supervision in these areas should be implemented. Our findings contribute to understanding the movement of pigs and the associated influencing factors in a big pig producing province in China, and the supervision strategies proposed in this study can be extended to other regions in China if proved to be viable.",2021,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,193,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105396,#204,Shi 2021
Characteristics of the spatio-temporal network of cattle movements in France over a 5-year period,"Dutta, BL; Ezanno, P; Vergu, E","A good knowledge of the specificities of the animal trade network is highly valuable to better control pathogen spread on a large regional to transnational scale. Because of their temporal dynamical nature, studying multi-annual datasets is particularly needed to investigate whether structural patterns are stable over the years. In this study, we analysed the French cattle movement network from 2005 to 2009 for different spatial granularities and temporal windows, with the three-fold objective of exploring temporal variations of the main network characteristics, computing proxies for pathogen spread on this network, which accounts for its time-varying properties and identifying specificities related to the main types of animals and farms (dairy versus beef). Network properties did not qualitatively vary among different temporal and spatial granularities. About 40% of the holdings and 80% of the communes were directly interconnected. The width of the aggregation time window barely impacted normalised distributions of indicators. A period of 8-16 weeks would suffice for robust estimation of their main trends, whereas longer periods would provide more details on tails. The dynamic nature of the network could be seen through the small overlap between consecutive networks with 65% of common active nodes for only 3% of common links over 2005-2009. To control pathogen spread on such a network, by reducing the largest strongly connected component by more than 80%, movements should be prevented from 1 to 5% of the holdings with the highest centrality in the previous year network. The analysis of breed-wise and herd-wise subnetworks, dairy, beef and mixed, reveals similar trends in temporal variation of average indicators and their distributions. The link-based backbones of beef subnetworks seem to be more stable over time than those of other subnetworks. At a regional scale, node reachability accounting for time-respecting paths, as proxy of epidemic burden, is greater for a dairy region than for a beef region. This highlights the importance of considering local specificities and temporal dynamics of animal trade networks when evaluating control measures of pathogen spread. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Role of Cattle Movements in Bovine Tuberculosis Spread in France between 2005 and 2014,"Palisson, A; Courcoul, A; Durand, B","Live animal movements are a major transmission route for the spread of infectious agents such as Mycobacterium bovis, the main agent of bovine Tuberculosis (bTB). France became officially bTB-free in 2001, but M. bovis is still circulating in the cattle population, with about a hundred of outbreaks per year, most located in a few geographic areas. The aim of this study was to analyse the role of cattle movements in bTB spread in France between 2005 and 2014, using social network analysis and logistic regression models. At a global scale, the trade network was studied to assess the association between several centrality measures and bTB infection though a case-control analysis. The bTB infection status was associated with a higher in-degree (odds-ratio [OR] = 2.4 [1.1-5.4]) and with a higher ingoing contact chain (OR = 2.2 [1.0-4.7]). At a more local scale, a second case-control analysis was conducted to estimate the relative importance of cattle movements and spatial neighbourhood. Only direct purchase from infected herds was shown to be associated with bTB infection (OR = 2.9 [1.7-5.2]), spatial proximity to infected herds being the predominant risk factor, with decreasing ORs when distance increases. Indeed, the population attributable fraction was 12% [5%-18%] for cattle movements and 73% [68%-78%] for spatial neighbourhood. Based on these results, networks of potential effective contacts between herds were built and analysed for the three major spoligotypes reported in France. In these networks, the links representing cattle movements were associated with higher edge betweenness than those representing the spatial proximity between infected herds. They were often links connecting distinct communities and sometimes distinct geographical areas. Therefore, although their role was quantitatively lower than the one of spatial neighbourhood, cattle movements appear to have been essential in the French bTB dynamics between 2005 and 2014.",2016,PLOS ONE,11,3,,10.1371/journal.pone.0152578,#208,Palisson 2016
Unraveling the contact patterns and network structure of pig shipments in the United States and its association with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) outbreaks,"Lee, K; Polson, D; Lowe, E; Main, R; Holtkamp, D; Martínez-López, B","The analysis of the pork value chain is becoming key to understanding the risk of infectious disease dissemination in the swine industry. In this study, we used social network analysis to characterize the swine shipment network structure and properties in a typical multisite swine production system in the US. We also aimed to evaluate the association between network properties and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) transmission between production sites. We analyzed the 109,868 swine shipments transporting over 93 million swine between more than 500 production sites from 2012 to 2014. A total of 248 PRRSV positive occurrences were reported from 79 production sites during those 3 years. The temporal dynamics of swine shipments was evaluated by computing network properties in one-month and three-month networks. The association of PRRS occurrence in sow farms with centrality properties from one-month and three-month networks was assessed by using the multilevel logistic regression. All monthly networks showed a scale-free network topology with positive degree assortativity. The regression model revealed that out-degree centrality had a negative association with PRRS occurrence in sow farms in both one-month and three-month networks [OR= 0.79 (95% CI, 0.63-0.99) in one-month network and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.36, 0.88) in three-month network] and in-closeness centrality model was positively associated with PRRS occurrence in sow farms in the three-month network [OR= 2.45 (95% CI, 1.14-5.26)]. We also describe how the occurrence of porcine epidemic diarrheac (PED) outbreaks severely affected the network structure as well as the PRRS occurrence reports and its association with centrality measures in sow farms. The structure of the swine shipment network and the connectivity between production sites influenced on the PRRSV transmission. The use of network topology and characteristics combining with spatial analysis based on fine scale geographical location of production sites will be useful to inform the design of more cost-efficient, risk-based surveillance and control measures for PRRSV as well as other diseases in the US swine industry.

Unveiling invisible farm-to-farm PRRSV-2 transmission links and routes through transmission tree and network analysis,"Pamornchainavakul, N; Makau, DN; Paploski, IAD; Corzo, CA; Vanderwaal, K","The United States (U.S.) swine industry has struggled to control porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) for decades, yet the causative virus, PRRSV-2, continues to circulate and rapidly diverges into new variants. In the swine industry, the farm is typically the epidemiological unit for monitoring, prevention, and control; breaking transmission among farms is a critical step in containing disease spread. Despite this, our understanding of farm transmission still is inadequate, precluding the development of tailored control strategies. Therefore, our objective was to infer farm-to-farm transmission links, estimate farm-level transmissibility as defined by reproduction numbers (R), and identify associated risk factors for transmission using PRRSV-2 open reading frame 5 (ORF5) gene sequences, animal movement records, and other data from farms in a swine-dense region of the U.S. from 2014 to 2017. Timed phylogenetic and transmission tree analyses were performed on three sets of sequences (n = 206) from 144 farms that represented the three largest genetic variants of the virus in the study area. The length of inferred pig-to-pig infection chains that corresponded to pairs of farms connected via direct animal movement was used as a threshold value for identifying other feasible transmission links between farms; these links were then transformed into farm-to-farm transmission networks and calculated farm-level R-values. The median farm-level R was one (IQR = 1-2), whereas the R value of 28% of farms was more than one. Exponential random graph models were then used to evaluate the influence of farm attributes and/or farm relationships on the occurrence of farm-to-farm transmission links. These models showed that, even though most transmission events cannot be directly explained by animal movement, movement was strongly associated with transmission. This study demonstrates how integrative techniques may improve disease traceability in a data-rich era by providing a clearer picture of regional disease transmission.",2023,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,16,10,1721-1734,10.1111/eva.13596,#213,Pamornchainavakul 2023
"Combined application of social network and cluster detection analyses for temporal-spatial characterization of animal movements in Salamanca, Spain","Martínez-López, B; Perez, AM; Sánchez-Vizcaíno, JM","Social network analysis was used in combination with techniques for detection of temporal-spatial clusters to identify operations at high risk of receiving or dispatching pigs, from January through December 2005, in the Spanish province of Salamanca. The temporal-spatial structure of the network was explicitly analyzed to estimate the statistical significance of observed clusters. Significant(P < 0.01) temporal-spatial clusters identified were grouped into two compartments based on the nature and extent of the contacts among operations within the clusters. One of the compartments was identified from January through April, included a high proportion of extensive farms (0.39), and was likely to be related with the production and trade of Iberian pigs. The other compartment encompassed a smaller proportion of extensive farms (0.11: P < 0.01), took place from May through December, and was probably related to intensive production systems. Analysis of a sub-section of the network, which was selected based on the administrative division of Spain, yielded to the identification of a different set of clusters, showing that results of social network analysis may be sensitive to the extension of the information used in the analysis. The approach presented here will be useful for the implementation of differential surveillance, prevention, and control strategies at specific times and locations, which will aid in the optimization of human and financial resources.

Decoding the complexity of large-scale pork supply chain networks in China,"Cai, MS; Huang, G; Tan, YJ; Jiang, J; Zhou, ZB; Lu, X","Purpose With the development of global food markets, the structural properties of supply chain networks have become key factors affecting the ability to evaluate and control infectious diseases and food contamination. The purpose of this paper is to describe and characterize the nationwide pork supply chain networks (PSCNs) in China and to demonstrate the potential of using social network analysis (SNA) methods for accessing outbreaks of diseases and contaminations. Design/methodology/approach A large-scale PSCN with 17,582 nodes and 49,554 edges is constructed, using the pork trade data collected by the National Important Products Traceability System (NIPTS) in China. A network analysis is applied to investigate the static and dynamic characteristics of the annual network and monthly networks. Then, the metric maximum spreading capacity (MSC) is proposed to quantify the spreading capacity of farms and estimate the potential maximum epidemic size. The structure of the network with the spatio-temporal pattern of the African swine fever (ASF) outbreak in China in 2018 was also analysed. Findings The results indicate that the out-degree distribution of farms approximately followed a power law. The pork supply market in China was active during April to July and December to January. The MSC is capable of estimating the potential maximum epidemic size of an outbreak, and the spreading of ASF was positively correlated with the effective distance from the origin city infected by ASF, rather than the geographical distance. Originality/value Empirical research on PSCNs in China is scarce due to the lack of comprehensive supply chain data. This study fills this gap by systematically examining the nationwide PSCN of China with large-scale reliable empirical data. The usage of MSC and effective distance can inform the implementation of risk-based control programmes for diseases and contaminations on PSCNs.",2020,INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS,120,8,1483-1500,10.1108/IMDS-12-2019-0689,#217,Cai 2020

A cross-sectional survey consisting of a questionnaire was used in a hotspot area for FMD: Xayabouli Province, Lao People's Democratic Republic. A total of 189 respondents were interviewed. We found that the key players in this network were people who were involved with more than one species of animal or occupation (multipurpose occupational node), which represents the highest number of activities of animals moved off the holding (shown with the highest out-degree centrality) and a high likelihood of being an intermediary between others (shown with the highest betweenness centrality). Moreover, the results show that the animals moved to and away from each node had few connections. Some nodes (such as traders) always received animals from the same group of cattle owners at different times. The subgroup connection within this network has many weak components, which means a connection in this network shows that some people can be reached by others, but most people were not. In this way, the number of connections present in the network was low when we defined the proportion of observed connections with all possible connections (density). These findings indicate that the network might not be busy; only one type of node is dominant which enables increased control of disease spread. We recommend that the relevant authorities implement control measures regarding the key players, which is the best way to effectively control the spread of infectious diseases.",2019,PEERJ,6,,,10.7717/peerj.6177,#218,Poolkhet 2019
"Predictive gravity models of livestock mobility in Mauritania: The effects of supply, demand and cultural factors","Nicolas, G; Apolloni, A; Coste, C; Wint, GRW; Lancelot, R; Gilbert, M","Animal movements are typically driven by areas of supply and demand for animal products and by the seasonality of production and demand. As animals can potentially spread infectious diseases, disease prevention can benefit from a better understanding of the factors influencing movements patterns in space and time. In Mauritania, an important cultural event, called the Tabaski (Aid el Kebir) strongly affects timing and structure of movements, and due to the arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, the season can also influence movement patterns. In order to better characterize the animal movements patterns, a survey was carried out in 2014, and those data were analysed here using social network analysis (SNA) metrics and used to train predictive gravity models. More specifically, we aimed to contrast the movements structure by ruminant species, season (Tabaski vs. Non-Tabaski) and mode of transport (truck vs. foot). The networks differed according to the species, and to the season, with a changed proportion of truck vs. foot movements. The gravity models were able to predict the probability of a movement link between two locations with moderate to good accuracy (AUC ranging from 0.76 to 0.97), according to species, seasons, and mode of transport, but we failed to predict the traded volume of those trade links. The significant predictor variables of a movement link were the human and sheep population at the source and origin, and the distance separating the locations. Though some improvements would be needed to predict traded volumes and better account for the barriers to mobility, the results provide useful predictions to inform epidemiological models in space and time, and, upon external validation, could be useful to predict movements at a larger regional scale.",2018,PLOS ONE,13,7,,10.1371/journal.pone.0199547,#223,Nicolas 2018
Cattle movements in Northern Ireland form a robust network: implications for disease management,"Brown, E; Marshall, AH; Mitchell, HJ; Byrne, AW","The movements of undetected infected animals can facilitate long-distance pathogen spread, making control and eradication difficult by (re)infecting disease-free populations. Characterising movement patterns is essential in understanding pathogen spread and how potential interventions, particularly animal movement restrictions, could help as a control mechanism. In Northern Ireland (NI), cattle movements are important contributors to a significant portion of agricultural trade. They can be disrupted due to statutory interventions, for example, during bovine tuberculosis (bTB) control. Identifying populations at risk of becoming infected would allow for improved resource allocation. This could be through targeting herds with an above-average risk of becoming infected or spreading (amplifying) infection, and restricting their movement to manage future outbreaks.In this study, cattle movements were investigated using social network analysis (SNA) at the monthly temporal scale across NI during 2010-2015. Targeted and random herd restrictions were compared and their impact on the structure and connectivity of the networks' was assessed (e.g. connected component subgraphs). This work was contextualised in relation to bTB, the most persistent infectious disease currently impacting agriculture in NI, where reduced connectivity would represent potential reduced vulnerability from infection introduction.There was seasonal variation in network size and level of connectivity with spring and autumn being the largest and most connected due to common farming practices in NI. Across the study period, there was limited inter-annual variation in global network metrics. On average there were 6.28 movements between each pair of nodes each month, low reciprocity (mean of 0.155) and the networks were moderately accessible with an average path length of 4.28. Movements were not confined to within each disease management area but frequently occurred between these areas (mean assortativity of -0.0731) and herds with high degree interacted with herds of low degree (mean assortativity of -0.351). The Giant Weakly Connected Component (GWCC) spanned most of the networks (between 75% and 100% of nodes); however the Giant Strongly Connected Component (GSCC) included, at most, 23% of the network. There was heterogeneous contributions across NI with little participation in the GSCC from some disease management areas, and the GSCC was comprised predominantly of 'beef breeders', 'beef rearers', and 'other/mixed' type herds. Targeted restrictions were more effective at fragmenting the network than randomly restricting movements when 25% of nodes or more were removed. Cattle networks in NI are extremely interconnected and robust to movement restrictions, suggesting potential vulnerability to movement-facilitated pathogen spread, such as bTB.",2019,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,170,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2019.104740,#225,Brown 2019
Network analysis of cattle movements in Ecuador,"Vinueza, RL; Durand, B; Zanella, G","We used cattle movement data in Ecuador for 2017 and 2018 to build two types of cattle networks: a network including all cattle movements accounting for a disease of rapid spread like foot and mouth disease and a network including only the cows accounting for brucellosis, a disease of slow evolution occurring mainly in adult females. Parishes (the smallest geographical units) were considered as nodes and cattle movements between parishes as links. Network indicators calculated at the annual and monthly levels were close for both types of networks. For both networks, the largest strong component at the annual level included > 90% of nodes and the largest weak component included all nodes indicating a very low fragmentation. A percolation analysis indicated that most of the parishes needed to be removed to eliminate the largest strong components. Based on some network characteristics we established that a highly transmissible disease could spread rapidly and that an infection of slower transmission such as brucellosis could spread within local clusters. These features should be taken into account when considering preventing measures in Ecuador in the case of an emerging disease like foot and mouth disease or control measures for an endemic disease like brucellosis.",2022,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,201,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105608,#227,Vinueza 2022
Spatio-temporal patterns and characteristics of swine shipments in the US based on Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection,"Gorsich, EE; Miller, RS; Mask, HM; Hallman, C; Portacci, K; Webb, CT","Domestic swine production in the United States is a critical economic and food security industry, yet there is currently no large-scale quantitative assessment of swine shipments available to support risk assessments. In this study, we provide a national-level characterization of the swine industry by quantifying the demographic (i.e. age, sex) patterns, spatio-temporal patterns, and the production diversity within swine shipments. We characterize annual networks of swine shipments using a 30% stratified sample of Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI), which are required for the interstate movement of agricultural animals. We used ICVIs in 2010 and 2011 from eight states that represent 36% of swine operations and 63% of the U.S. swine industry. Our analyses reflect an integrated and spatially structured industry with high levels of spatial heterogeneity. Most shipments carried young swine for feeding or breeding purposes and carried a median of 330 head (range: 1-6,500). Geographically, most shipments went to and were shipped from Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska. This work, therefore, suggests that although the swine industry is variable in terms of its size and type of swine, counties in states historically known for breeding and feeding operations are consistently more central to the shipment network.",2019,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,9,,,10.1038/s41598-019-40556-z,#228,Gorsich 2019
Dynamic network measures reveal the impact of cattle markets and alpine summering on the risk of epidemic outbreaks in the Swiss cattle population,"Vidondo, B; Voelkl, B","Background: Livestock herds are interconnected with each other via an intricate network of transports of animals which represents a potential substrate for the spread of epidemic diseases. We analysed four years (2012-2015) of daily bovine transports to assess the risk of disease transmission and identify times and locations where monitoring would be most effective. Specifically, we investigated how the seasonal dynamics of transport networks, driven by the alpine summering and traditional cattle markets, affect the risk of epidemic outbreaks.Results: We found strong and consistent seasonal variation in several structural network measures as well as in measures for outbreak risk. Analysis of the consequences of excluding markets, dealers and alpine pastures from the network shows that markets contribute much more to the overall outbreak risk than alpine summering. Static descriptors of monthly transport networks were poor predictors of outbreak risk emanating from individual holdings; a dynamic measure, which takes the temporal structure of the network into account, gave better risk estimates. A stochastic simulation suggests that targeted surveillance based on this dynamic network allows a higher detection rate and smaller outbreak size at detection than compared to other sampling schemes.Conclusions: Dynamic measures based on time-stamped data-the outgoing contact chain-can give better risk estimates and could help to improve surveillance schemes. Using this measure we find evidence that even in a country with intense summering practice, markets continue being the prime risk factor for the spread of contagious diseases.",2018,BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH,14,,,10.1186/s12917-018-1406-3,#229,Vidondo 2018
Exploring the role of auction markets in cattle movements within Great Britain,"Robinson, SE; Christley, RM","Within Great Britain cattle are often traded at regional markets, of which there are approximately 200 located throughout England, Scotland and Wales. The movement of animals through markets was important in the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus during the 2001 GB outbreak. Here, we describe the movements of cattle to and from markets for 2002-2004 and, using social network analysis, we construct networks based on these movements. In 2002, 56,227 animal holdings (AH) sent cattle to 222 cattle auction markets, compared to 58,476 AH and 187 auction markets in 2004. Auction markets vary considerably in their trading with AH. The majority of markets received animals from less than 50 AH, but one received animals from as many as 6155 AH during a year. The distances travelled between origin AH and destination AH when cattle move ""directly"" were found to be significantly shorter compared to distances between origin and destination AH where the movement occurred via a market. However, the vast majority of distances moved, for both types of movements, were less than 50 km. Some auction markets appear as highly connected premises within the contact network and are associated with high betweenness scores. However AH also occupy positions central to the contact network. The variation in the characteristics and role of individual markets within the contact network suggests important differences in risk of disease transmission associated with each market. Inclusion of network parameters, when considering the risk associated with moving cattle through auction markets may enhance the development of effective targeted disease control strategies.

Mapping US cattle shipment networks: Spatial and temporal patterns of trade communities from 2009 to 2011,"Gorsich, EE; Luis, AD; Buhnerkempe, MG; Grear, DA; Portacci, K; Miller, RS; Webb, CT","The application of network analysis to cattle shipments broadens our understanding of shipment patterns beyond pairwise interactions to the network as a whole. Such a quantitative description of cattle shipments in the U.S. can identify trade communities, describe temporal shipment patterns, and inform the design of disease surveillance and control strategies. Here, we analyze a longitudinal dataset of beef and dairy cattle shipments from 2009 to 2011 in the United States to characterize communities within the broader cattle shipment network, which are groups of counties that ship mostly to each other. Because shipments occur over time, we aggregate the data at various temporal scales to examine the consistency of network and community structure over time. Our results identified nine large (>50 counties) communities based on shipments of beef cattle in 2009 aggregated into an annual network and nine large communities based on shipments of dairy cattle. The size and connectance of the shipment network was highly dynamic; monthly networks were smaller than yearly networks and revealed seasonal shipment patterns consistent across years. Comparison of the shipment network over time showed largely consistent shipping patterns, such that communities identified on annual networks of beef and diary shipments from 2009 still represented 41-95% of shipments in monthly networks from 2009 and 41-66% of shipments from networks in 2010 and 2011. The temporal aspects of cattle shipments suggest that future applications of the U.S. cattle shipment network should consider seasonal shipment patterns. However, the consistent within-community shipping patterns indicate that yearly communities could provide a reasonable way to group regions for management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Local cattle movements in response to ongoing bovine tuberculosis zonation and regulations in Michigan, USA","Grear, DA; Kaneene, JB; Averill, JJ; Webb, CT","Bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) is an ongoing management issue in the state of Michigan with eradication from livestock as the ultimate goal. Eradication has been a challenge owing to the presence of a wildlife reservoir; competing interests in managing the livestock and wildlife hosts; and many uncertainties in transmission dynamics of M. bovis. One of the cornerstones of the eradication effort has been to stop movement of infected cattle among farms by imposing strict pre-movement testing on cattle being moved within, into and out of the Modified Accredited Zone (MAZ) in northeastern Michigan. In addition to pre-movement tuberculosis testing, detailed information about the origin and destination premises of all movements within the MAZ has been recorded in Michigan. The aim of this study was to describe the farm-to-farm movements of cattle within the MAZ, report changes in the network of movements during a 6-year period when the MAZ was a constant size (2004-2009), and examine changes in cattle movement patterns when the MAZ was reduced from 11 to 5 counties in 2010. Non-slaughter cattle movement within the MAZ was characterized by predominantly local movements at a sub-county scale. Premises that shipped cattle were primarily senders or receivers, but rarely both. From 2004 to 2009, the number of cattle shipped, size of shipments, number of shipments and distance of shipments decreased; there was little change in the network patterns of interaction among individual premises; and interactions among all premises became more disconnected. After accounting for MAZ size, there were also no changes in cattle movement network patterns following the reduction of the MAZ in 2010. The movement of cattle was likely not a key risk factor in bTB spread among premises in the MAZ during the study period and the effect of zonation and movement regulations appeared to further reduce the risk of tuberculosis spread via cattle movements among farms in Michigan's MAZ.

The role of live poultry movement and live bird market biosecurity in the epidemiology of influenza A (H7N9): A cross-sectional observational study in four eastern China provinces,"Zhou, XY; Li, Y; Wang, YM; Edwards, J; Guo, FS; Clements, ACA; Huang, BX; Magalhaes, RJS",Background: A new reassortant influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged early 2013 in eastern China. Exposure to H7N9 infected poultry at live bird markets (LBM) was implicated as the main risk factor for human infection. We aimed to identify the role of LBM biosecurity indicators and poultry movement in the affected areas.Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 24 LBMs at the beginning of H7N9 outbreak in all affected provinces. We used univariable analysis to identify the biosecurity factors associated with the H7N9 presence in LBMs and social network and spatial analysis to quantify the connectivity and geographic variation in the connectivity of poultry movements.Results: Chickens were the predominant poultry species traded by affected LBMs. The presence of H7N9 in LBMs was significantly associated with the type of LBM and with LBMs that sold chicken to other markets. The chicken movements were significantly spatially clustered and was highest in counties from Jiangsu and Anhui provinces.Conclusion: LBM biosecurity and chicken movement played an important role in the emergence of H7N9. This study identified highly connected areas in eastern China which continue to report human infections highlighting candidate areas for more detailed epidemiological investigations.

Dynamical Patterns of Cattle Trade Movements,"Bajardi, P; Barrat, A; Natale, F; Savini, L; Colizza, V","Despite their importance for the spread of zoonotic diseases, our understanding of the dynamical aspects characterizing the movements of farmed animal populations remains limited as these systems are traditionally studied as static objects and through simplified approximations. By leveraging on the network science approach, here we are able for the first time to fully analyze the longitudinal dataset of Italian cattle movements that reports the mobility of individual animals among farms on a daily basis. The complexity and inter-relations between topology, function and dynamical nature of the system are characterized at different spatial and time resolutions, in order to uncover patterns and vulnerabilities fundamental for the definition of targeted prevention and control measures for zoonotic diseases. Results show how the stationarity of statistical distributions coexists with a strong and non-trivial evolutionary dynamics at the node and link levels, on all timescales. Traditional static views of the displacement network hide important patterns of structural changes affecting nodes' centrality and farms' spreading potential, thus limiting the efficiency of interventions based on partial longitudinal information. By fully taking into account the longitudinal dimension, we propose a novel definition of dynamical motifs that is able to uncover the presence of a temporal arrow describing the evolution of the system and the causality patterns of its displacements, shedding light on mechanisms that may play a crucial role in the definition of preventive actions.",2011,PLOS ONE,6,5,,10.1371/journal.pone.0019869,#252,Bajardi 2011
"Transmission Dynamics of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus in Hokkaido, Japan by Phylogenetic and Epidemiological Network Approaches","Hirose, S; Notsu, K; Ito, S; Sakoda, Y; Isoda, N","Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) caused by BVD virus (BVDV) leads to economic loss worldwide. Cattle that are persistently infected (PI) with BVDV are known to play an important role in viral transmission in association with the animal movement, as they shed the virus during their lifetime. In this research, the ""hot spot"" for BVD transmission was estimated by combining phylogenetic and epidemiological analyses for PI cattle and cattle that lived together on BVDV affected farms in Tokachi district, Hokkaido prefecture, Japan. Viral isolates were genetically categorized into BVDV-1a, 1b, and 2a, based on the nucleotide sequence of the entire E2 region. In BVDV genotype 1, subgenotype b (BVDV-1b), cluster I was identified as the majority in Tokachi district. Network analysis indicated that 12 of the 15 affected farms had cattle movements from other facilities (PI-network) and farms affected with BVDV-1b cluster I consisted of a large network. It was implied that the number of cattle movements themselves would be a risk of BVD transmission, using the PageRank algorithm. Therefore, these results demonstrate that cattle movements would contribute to disease spread and the combination of virological and epidemiological analysis methods would be beneficial in determining possible virus transmission routes.",2021,PATHOGENS,10,8,,10.3390/pathogens10080922,#254,Hirose 2021
"Analysis of the movement of live broilers in Guangxi, China and implications for avian influenza control","Tang, H; Fournié, G; Li, JM; Zou, LB; Shen, CJ; Wang, YM; Cai, C; Edwards, J; Robertson, ID; Huang, BX; Bruce, M","Most Chinese provinces have a daily-updated database of live animal movements; however, the data are not efficiently utilized to support interventions to control H7N9 and other avian influenzas. Based on official records, this study assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of live broilers moved out of and within Guangxi in 2017. The yearly and monthly networks were analyzed for inter- and intra-provincial movements, respectively. Approximately 200,000 movements occurred in 2017, involving the transport of 200 million live broilers from Guangxi. Although Guangxi exported to 24 out of 32 provinces of China, 95% of inter-provincial movements occurred with three bordering provinces. Within Guangxi, counties were highly connected through the live broiler movements, creating conditions for rapid virus spreading throughout the province. Interestingly, a peak in movements during the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, late January in 2017, was not observed in this study, likely due to H7N9-related control measures constraining live bird trading. Both intra- and inter-provincial movements in March 2017 were significantly higher than in other months of that year, suggesting that dramatic price changes may influence the movement's network and reshape the risk pathways. However, despite these variations, the same small proportion of counties (less than 20%) exporting/importing more than 90% of inter- and intra-provincial movements remains the same throughout the year. Interventions, particularly surveillance and improving biosecurity, targeted to those counties are thus likely to be more effective for avian influenza risk mitigation than implemented indiscriminately. Additionally, simulations further demonstrated that targeting counties according to their degree or betweenness in the movement network would be the most efficient way to limit disease transmission via broiler movements. The study findings provide evidence to support the design of risk-based control interventions for H7N9 and all other avian influenza viruses in broiler value chains in Guangxi.",2022,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,69,4,E775-E787,10.1111/tbed.14351,#255,Tang 2022
Network modeling of BVD transmission,"Tinsley, M; Lewis, FI; Brülisauer, F","Endemic diseases of cattle, such as bovine viral diarrhea, have significant impact on production efficiency of food of animal origin with consequences for animal welfare and climate change reduction targets. Many modeling studies focus on the local scale, examining the on-farm dynamics of this infectious disease. However, insight into prevalence and control across a network of farms ultimately requires a network level approach. Here, we implement understanding of infection dynamics, gained through these detailed on-farm modeling studies, to produce a national scale model of bovine viral diarrhea virus transmission. The complex disease epidemiology and on-farm dynamics are approximated using SIS dynamics with each farm treated as a single unit. Using a top down approach, we estimate on-farm parameters associated with contraction and subsequent clearance from infection at herd level.

Model-guided suggestions for targeted surveillance based on cattle shipments in the US,"Gorsich, EE; McKee, CD; Grear, DA; Miller, RS; Portacci, K; Lindström, T; Webb, CT","Risk-based sampling is an essential component of livestock health surveillance because it targets resources towards sub-populations with a higher risk of infection. Risk-based surveillance in U.S. livestock is limited because the locations of high-risk herds are often unknown and data to identify high-risk herds based on shipments are often unavailable. In this study, we use a novel, data-driven network model for the shipments of cattle in the U.S. (the U.S. Animal Movement Model, USAMM) to provide surveillance suggestions for cattle imported into the U.S. from Mexico. We describe the volume and locations where cattle are imported and analyze their predicted shipment patterns to identify counties that are most likely to receive shipments of imported cattle. Our results suggest that most imported cattle are sent to relatively few counties. Surveillance at 10 counties is predicted to sample 22-34% of imported cattle while surveillance at 50 counties is predicted to sample 43%-61% of imported cattle. These findings are based on the assumption that USAMM accurately describes the shipments of imported cattle because their shipments are not tracked separately from the remainder of the U.S. herd. However, we analyze two additional datasets - Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection and brand inspection data - to ensure that the characteristics of potential post-import shipments do not change on an annual scale and are not dependent on the dataset informing our analyses. Overall, these results highlight the utility of USAMM to inform targeted surveillance strategies when complete shipment information is unavailable.",2018,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,150,,52-59,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.12.004,#260,Gorsich 2018
Modelling of paratuberculosis spread between dairy cattle farms at a regional scale,"Beaunée, G; Vergu, E; Ezanno, P","Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) causes Johne's disease, with large economic consequences for dairy cattle producers worldwide. Map spread between farms is mainly due to animal movements. Locally, herd size and management are expected to influence infection dynamics. To provide a better understanding of Map spread between dairy cattle farms at a regional scale, we describe the first spatio-temporal model accounting simultaneously for population and infection dynamics and indirect local transmission within dairy farms, and between-farm transmission through animal trade. This model is applied to Brittany, a French region characterized by a high density of dairy cattle, based on data on animal trade, herd size and farm management (birth, death, renewal, and culling) from 2005 to 2013 for 12 857 dairy farms. In all simulated scenarios, Map infection highly persisted at the metapopulation scale. The characteristics of initially infected farms strongly impacted the regional Map spread. Network-related features of incident farms influenced their ability to contaminate disease-free farms. At the herd level, we highlighted a balanced effect of the number of animals purchased: when large, it led to a high probability of farm infection but to a low persistence. This effect was reduced when prevalence in initially infected farms increased. Implications of our findings in the current enzootic situation are that the risk of infection quickly becomes high for farms buying more than three animals per year. Even in regions with a low proportion of infected farms, Map spread will not fade out spontaneously without the use of effective control strategies.",2015,VETERINARY RESEARCH,46,,,10.1186/s13567-015-0247-3,#261,Beaunée 2015
Contact structure and <i>Salmonella</i> control in the network of pig movements in France,"Lurette, A; Belloc, C; Keeling, M","Movement restrictions are a key measure to control pathogen transmission in the swine industry due when purchasing animals. Here recorded animal movements between herds in France are used to generate a network model. This network consists of different types of herds together with specific links between them, with some herds being suppliers (of reproductive gilts or piglets) for others. The connectivity between herds within this network exhibits a highly variable number of contacts according to the type of animal moved (8 kg piglets, 25 kg piglets or reproductive gilts). A simulation model is used to assess the impact of control measures aimed at reducing Salmonella prevalence at every level of the production network. In particular we consider restricting animal purchases according to the infectious status of herds (level of prevalence) such that animals do not move from higher to lower herd prevalence; this measure can additionally be combined with infection control at the herd-level. When Salmonella initially invades the production structure, the restriction of animal movements alone is sufficient to significantly decrease the number of herds infected. In contrast, once infection is endemic within the production structure, movement restrictions have to be supplemented by within-herd control applied to a large proportion of herds to reduce the pathogen prevalence. These results demonstrate the important distinction between the control of epidemics and endemic infections and highlight the different impacts of control measures at the within- and at the between-herd levels.

Multilayer network analysis of FMD transmission and containment among beef cattle farms,"Yi, CL; Yang, QH; Scoglio, CM","As a highly contagious livestock viral disease, foot-and-mouth disease poses a great threat to the beef-cattle industry. Direct animal movement is always considered as a major route for between-farm transmission of FMD virus. Sharing contaminated equipment and vehicles have also attracted increasing interests as an indirect but considerable route for FMD virus transmission. With the rapid development of communication technologies, information-sharing techniques have been used to control epidemics. In this paper, we built farm-level time-series three-layer networks to simulate the between-farm FMD virus transmission in southwest Kansas by cattle movements (direct-contact layer) and truck visits (indirect-contact layer) and evaluate the impact of information-sharing techniques (information-sharing layer) on mitigating the epidemic. Here, the information-sharing network is defined as the structure that enables the quarantine of farms that are connected with infected farms. When a farm is infected, its infection status is shared with the neighboring farms in the information-sharing network, which in turn become quarantined. The results show that truck visits can enlarge the epidemic size and prolong the epidemic duration of the FMD outbreak by cattle movements, and that the information-sharing technique is able to mitigate the epidemic. The mitigation effect of the information-sharing network varies with the information-sharing network topology and different participation levels. In general, an increased participation leads to a decreased epidemic size and an increased quarantine size. We compared the mitigation performance of three different information-sharing networks (random network, contact-based network, and distance-based network) and found the outbreak on the network with contact-based information-sharing layer has the smallest epidemic size under almost any participation level and smallest quarantine size with high participation. Furthermore, we explored the potential economic loss from the infection and the quarantine. By varying the ratio of the average loss of quarantine to the loss of infection, we found high participation results in reduced economic losses under the realistic assumption that culling costs are much greater than quarantine costs.",2022,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,12,1,,10.1038/s41598-022-19981-0,#265,Yi 2022
Contrasting animal movement and spatial connectivity networks in shaping transmission pathways of a genetically diverse virus,"VanderWaal, K; Paploski, IAD; Makau, DN; Corzo, CA","Analyses of livestock movement networks has become key to understanding an industry's vulnerability to infectious disease spread and for identifying farms that play disproportionate roles in pathogen dissemination. In addition to animal movements, many pathogens can spread between farms via mechanisms mediated by spatial proximity. Heterogeneities in contact patterns based on spatial proximity are less commonly considered in network studies, and studies that jointly consider spatial connectivity and animal movement are rare. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which movement versus spatial proximity networks determine the distribution of an economically important endemic virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), within a swine-dense region of the U.S. PRRSV can be classified into numerous phylogenetic lineages. Such data can be used to better resolve between-farm infection chains and elucidate types of contact most associated with transmission. Here, we construct movement and spatial proximity networks; farms within the networks were classified as cases if a given PRRSV lineage had been recovered at least once in a year for each of three years analyzed. We evaluated six lineages and sub-lineages across three years, and evaluated the epidemiological relevance of each network by applying network k-tests to statistically evaluate whether the pattern of case occurrence within the network was consistent with transmission via network linkages. Our results indicated that animal movements, not local area spread, play a dominant role in shaping transmission pathways, though there were differences amongst lineages. The median number of case farms inter-linked via animal movements was approximately 4.1x higher than random expectations (range: 1.7-13.7; p < 0.05, network k-test), whereas this measure was only 2.7x higher than random expectations for farms linked via spatial proximity (range: 1.3-5.4; p < 0.05, network k-test). For spatial proximity networks, contact based on proximities of < 5 km appeared to have greater epidemiological relevance than longer distances, likely related to diminishing probabilities of local area spread at greater distances. However, the greater overall levels of connectivity of the spatial network compared to the movement network highlights the vulnerability of pig populations to wide-spread transmission via this route.

The Feixi County poultry production network exhibited greater connectivity, which incorporated approximately 94% of the farms interviewed in a major component (a set of connected farms not linked with each other), mainly due to linkages of backyard farms through local produce stores and individual agents, whilst the Beizhen City network was more fragmented owing to independent in-house operations (from breed, raise, to slaughter and process) of a few large companies, with multiple smaller components. A range of factors influencing the contacts/movements among farms (act as bridges) were identified in this study. Ability to predict the pathway with the network characteristics on the basis of the factors, such as entity type and geographic location, is useful for developing risk-based approaches for disease prevention, surveillance, early detection, and effective controlling.",2018,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,65,6,1909-1919,10.1111/tbed.12972,#267,Sun 2018
Network analysis of cattle movements in Chile: Implications for pathogen spread and control,"Alocilla, O; Monti, G","Livestock movement between herds is one of the main routes for a pathogen to spread between herds. Understanding the contact structure, patterns and importance of specific individuals and classes can help assess dissemination risk, control, and surveillance measures. In this study, the cattle herd's contact structure in southern Chile was characterized based on the study of movement within one of the most important geographical regions for livestock production. Using Social Network Analysis, network measures of centrality, network cohesion and contact chains were estimated to identify essential features that can influence disease transmission among premises. Static and disaggregated by season networks were built for the entire set of nodes and for the Los Rios region animal flow only. For all networks, it was found that most nodes had a few movements; meanwhile, a small number of them were highly connected. Livestock markets have a powerful influence over the networks, being the most connected and central nodes, appearing as candidates for surveillance because of their possible role as super spreaders. Nodes attributes were associated with the likelihood of having high contact chains measures, such as herd class, location, and presence of markets anywhere on the contact chain. This work is the first deep analysis in livestock flows in Chile and shows the importance of animal movement data interpretation to assess pathogen risk spread in the country.",2022,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,204,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105644,#271,Alocilla 2022
Animal movement network analysis as a tool to map farms serving as contamination source in cattle cysticercosis,"Aragao, SC; Ito, PKRK; Paulan, SC; Utsunomyia, YT; Grisi, JHH; Nunes, CM","Bovine cysticercosis is a problem distributed worldwide that result in economic losses mainly due to the condemnation of infected carcasses. One of the difficulties in applying control measures is the identification of the source of infection, especially because cattle are typically acquired from multiple farms. Here, we tested the utility of an animal movement network constructed with data from a farm that acquires cattle from several other different farms to map the major contributors of cysticercosis propagation. Additionally, based on the results of the network analysis, we deployed a sanitary management and drug treatment scheme to decrease cysticercosis' occurrence in the farm. Six farms that had commercial trades were identified by the animal movement network and characterized as the main contributors to the occurrence of cysticercosis in the studied farm. The identification of farms with a putative risk of Taenia saginata infection using the animal movement network along with the proper sanitary management and drug treatment resulted in a gradual decrease in cysticercosis prevalence, from 25% in 2010 to 3.7% in 2011 and 1.8% in 2012. These results suggest that the animal movement network can contribute towards controlling bovine cysticercosis, thus minimizing economic losses and preventing human taeniasis.",2017,PESQUISA VETERINARIA BRASILEIRA,37,4,319-324,10.1590/S0100-736X2017000400004,#272,Aragao 2017
Network Analysis of Cattle Movement in Mato Grosso Do Sul (Brazil) and Implications for Foot-and-Mouth Disease,"de Menezes, TC; Luna, I; de Miranda, SHG","Foot-and mouth disease (FMD) is an animal disease that generates many economic impacts and sanctions on the international market. In 2018, Brazil, the world's largest beef exporter, had the recognition by World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as a country free of FMD with vaccination and proposed to withdraw FMD vaccination throughout the country, based on a 10-year schedule, beginning in 2019. Therefore, Brazil needs studies to help the decision-making process, particularly regarding the availability of resources for strengthening of official animal health services. The state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) was chosen to be analyzed for three reasons: the size of its herd, the economic importance of its livestock and its location-which lies on the border with Paraguay and Bolivia. The current study adopted the Social Network Analysis and performed an exploratory analysis of cattle movement in MS. The most central municipalities in the networks were identified and they can be seen as crucial in strategies to monitor animal movement and to control outbreaks. The cattle movement networks demonstrated to be strongly connected, implying a high-speed potential FMD diffusion, in case of reintroduction. In a second stage, we performed an exploratory analysis of animal movement within the state, assuming distinct points in time for the identification of animal origin. The results of the analysis underlined the need and relevance of investing in animal control, sanitary education for producers and equipment and technologies to assist in the early detection, diagnosis, and eradication of outbreaks in a fast and efficient manner, preventing a possible outbreak from spreading to other regions.",2020,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,7,,,10.3389/fvets.2020.00219,#277,deMenezes 2020
No long-term influence of movement restriction regulations on the contact-structure between and within cattle holding types in the Netherlands,"Brouwer, H; Bartels, CJM; Stegeman, A; van Schaik, G","Background: More and more countries hold databases on cattle movements. The primary purpose of the registration of cattle movements is to provide data for quick tracing of contagious animals in case of disease outbreaks and food safety scares. Nevertheless, these data can also be used for analytical studies to get insight into the nature of the contact structure between and within cattle holding types. This paper focuses on the effect post-2001 FMD movement regulations have had on the number of cattle movements between different and within the same cattle holding types. Important characteristics and dynamics of cattle movement patterns of Dutch cattle holding types were identified using data on cattle movements after the 2001 FMD outbreak.Results: The results showed that in 2001, just after the FMD outbreak when strict movement restriction regulations were in force, a reduced number of cattle movements was seen compared to before the FMD outbreak. However, the number of cattle movements off-farm for live trade and the number of imported cattle increased in the period 2002-2004 to higher levels than expected, i.e. to levels almost as high as before the FMD outbreak, despite operative movement restriction regulations. As the number of cattle movements to and from traders strongly decreased just after the FMD outbreak in 2001, traders regained their central role again in the network in the years 2002-2004.Conclusions: Quantifying the Dutch cattle contact structure between and within holding types up to 3.5 years after the FMD outbreak gave evidence that the post-FMD movement restriction regulations were not able to reduce the number of cattle movements in the longer term. With that the risk of a large epidemic increased. Quantifying contact structures based on animal movement data between different and within the same cattle holding types is important for targeting disease control and for assessing compliance with legislation.",2012,BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH,8,,,10.1186/1746-6148-8-188,#279,Brouwer 2012
Modeling the effectiveness of targeting Rift Valley fever virus vaccination using imperfect network information,"Sulaimon, TA; Chaters, GL; Nyasebwa, OM; Swai, ES; Cleaveland, S; Enright, J; Kao, RR; Johnson, PCD","Livestock movements contribute to the spread of several infectious diseases. Data on livestock movements can therefore be harnessed to guide policy on targeted interventions for controlling infectious livestock diseases, including Rift Valley fever (RVF)-a vaccine-preventable arboviral fever. Detailed livestock movement data are known to be useful for targeting control efforts including vaccination. These data are available in many countries, however, such data are generally lacking in others, including many in East Africa, where multiple RVF outbreaks have been reported in recent years. Available movement data are imperfect, and the impact of this uncertainty in the utility of movement data on informing targeting of vaccination is not fully understood. Here, we used a network simulation model to describe the spread of RVF within and between 398 wards in northern Tanzania connected by cattle movements, on which we evaluated the impact of targeting vaccination using imperfect movement data. We show that pre-emptive vaccination guided by only market movement permit data could prevent large outbreaks. Targeted control (either by the risk of RVF introduction or onward transmission) at any level of imperfect movement information is preferred over random vaccination, and any improvement in information reliability is advantageous to their effectiveness. Our modeling approach demonstrates how targeted interventions can be effectively used to inform animal and public health policies for disease control planning. This is particularly valuable in settings where detailed data on livestock movements are either unavailable or imperfect due to resource limitations in data collection, as well as challenges associated with poor compliance.",2023,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,10,,,10.3389/fvets.2023.1049633,#281,Sulaimon 2023
Network analyses using case-control data to describe and characterize the initial 2014 incursion of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in Canadian swine herds,"Perri, AM; Poljak, Z; Dewey, C; Harding, JCS; O'Sullivan, TL","The overall objective of this study was to describe the contact structure and animal movement patterns of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) case herds and matched control herds during the initial incursion of PEDV in Canada, and to evaluate possible mechanisms of spread during this period. Possible mechanisms of spread included transmission through a common-source, herd-to-herd transmission, and transmission due to low biosecurity. Three hypotheses were evaluated by assessing: 1) whether feed supplier, semen supplier and/or animal transportation company networks contained a higher proportion of case herds compared to randomly permuted networks, 2) whether the proportion of case herds in the giant weak component differed from randomly permuted networks, and 3) whether external herd biosecurity, defined as the number of mean contacts with other herds in a one-mode network, was different between case and control herds. The study period for recruiting case and control herds was from January 22, 2014 to March 1, 2014, and a 30-day history of each participating site was collected using a questionnaire. The study included swine herds located in central and eastern Canadian provinces. Multiple two-mode networks with swine herds and service suppliers were constructed. This included feed suppliers, animal movement, animal transportation companies, semen suppliers and a complete network with all service providers.The complete network consisted of 145 nodes. There were a total of 765 edges in the complete network and majority were between feed suppliers and primary herds 29.8% (228/765). The proportion of case herds in the largest feed supplier network was higher than what was expected using randomly permuted networks, suggesting that the likely mechanism of spread during this phase was a common-source through the feed network. A single feed supplier (FS1) had the highest out-degree and outgoing contact chain indicating its importance in disease spread throughout the feed and complete networks. Network descriptive measures, as well as the results of the hypotheses testing indicate little significance in the roles of animal movement, animal transportation companies, and semen suppliers during the initial phase of the 2014 Canadian PED outbreak.",2019,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,162,,18-28,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.11.001,#282,Perri 2019
Livestock trade network: potential for disease transmission and implications for risk-based surveillance on the island of Mayotte,"Kim, Y; Dommergues, L; Ben M'sa, A; Mérot, P; Cardinale, E; Edmunds, J; Pfeiffer, D; Fournié, G; Métras, R","The island of Mayotte is a department of France, an outermost region of the European Union located in the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and the coast of Eastern Africa. Due to its close connection to the African mainland and neighbouring islands, the island is under constant threat of introduction of infectious diseases of both human and animal origin. Here, using social network analysis and mathematical modelling, we assessed potential implications of livestock movements between communes in Mayotte for risk-based surveillance. Our analyses showed that communes in the central region of Mayotte acted as a hub in the livestock movement network. The majority of livestock movements occurred between communes in the central region and from communes in the central region to those in the outer region. Also, communes in the central region were more likely to be infected earlier than those in the outer region when the spread of an exotic infectious disease was simulated on the livestock movement network. The findings of this study, therefore, suggest that communes in the central region would play a major role in the spread of infectious diseases via livestock movements, which needs to be considered in the design of risk-based surveillance systems in Mayotte.",2018,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,8,,,10.1038/s41598-018-29999-y,#283,Kim 2018
"From network analysis to risk analysis-An approach to risk-based surveillance for bovine tuberculosis in Minnesota, US","Ribeiro-Lima, J; Enns, EA; Thompson, B; Craft, ME; Wells, SJ","Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) was first detected in 2005 in cattle in northwestern Minnesota (MN) through slaughter surveillance. By the end of 2008,12 cattle herds were infected with bTB, and the main cause for infection was determined to be the movement of infected animals between herds. Bovine tuberculosis was contained in a smaller area in northwestern Minnesota classified as modified accredited (MA), corresponding to a prevalence inferior to 0.1% in cattle. From January 2008 to 2011, all cattle movements within the bTB MA were recorded electronically. The primary objectives of this study were to characterize cattle movements within this region and identify cattle herds with higher risk of bTB introduction based on network parameters and known risk factors from the published literature. During the period that data was collected, 57,460 cattle were moved in 3762 movements corresponding to permits issued to 682 premises, mostly representing private farms, sale yards, slaughter facilities and county or state fairs. Although sale yards represented less than 2% of the premises (nodes), 60% of the movements were to or from a sale yard. The network showed an overall density of 0.4%, a clustering coefficient of 14.6% and a betweenness centralization index of 12.7%, reflecting the low connectivity of this cattle network. The degree distribution showed that 20% of nodes performed 90% of the movements. Farms were ranked based on the total risk score and divided into high, medium, and low risk groups based on the score and its variability. The higher risk group included 14% (n = 50) of the farms, corresponding to 80% of the cumulative risk for the farms in the bTB area. This analysis provides a baseline description about the contact structure of cattle movements in an area previously infected with bTB and develops a framework for a targeted surveillance approach for bTB to support future surveillance decisions.

"Social network analysis of the movement of poultry to and from live bird markets in Bali and Lombok, Indonesia","Kurscheid, J; Stevenson, M; Durr, PA; Toribio, JALML; Kurscheid, S; Ambarawati, IGAA; Abdurrahman, M; Fenwick, S","Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has resulted in large losses to the Indonesian poultry sector. Evidence suggests that live bird markets (LBMs) play an important role in the epidemiology of the disease. Knowledge of the frequency and type of contact between the various poultry market players should allow animal health authorities to develop a better understanding of factors influencing virus transmission between Indonesian villages. A questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in 17 LBMs on the neighbouring Indonesian islands of Bali and Lombok to investigate the movement patterns of poultry to and from markets. Using social network analyses, a network of contacts was created for each island from a total of 413 live poultry traders and 134 customers. Individual nodes with high degree and/or betweenness were identified in each network. The Lombok network was more dense and connected than the Bali network indicating that disease transmission would be more efficient in the Lombok network. Our findings indicate that whilst live poultry are typically transported over relatively short distances of approximately 10km, it is not uncommon for traders and customers to travel in excess of 100km to buy or sell poultry, which may facilitate the spread of disease over a large geographical area. This study highlights the different roles markets play in poultry movement networks and their potential for disease dissemination. The identification of highly influential market nodes allows authorities to target HPAI surveillance activities to locations where disease is more likely to be present, which is crucial in low-resource settings.",2017,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,64,6,2023-2033,10.1111/tbed.12613,#287,Kurscheid 2017
Evaluation of farm-level parameters derived from animal movements for use in risk-based surveillance programmes of cattle in Switzerland,"Schärrer, S; Widgren, S; Schwermer, H; Lindberg, A; Vidondo, B; Zinsstag, J; Reist, M","Background: This study focused on the descriptive analysis of cattle movements and farm-level parameters derived from cattle movements, which are considered to be generically suitable for risk-based surveillance systems in Switzerland for diseases where animal movements constitute an important risk pathway.Methods: A framework was developed to select farms for surveillance based on a risk score summarizing 5 parameters. The proposed framework was validated using data from the bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) surveillance programme in 2013.Results: A cumulative score was calculated per farm, including the following parameters; the maximum monthly ingoing contact chain (in 2012), the average number of animals per incoming movement, use of mixed alpine pastures and the number of weeks in 2012 a farm had movements registered. The final score for the farm depended on the distribution of the parameters. Different cut offs; 50, 90, 95 and 99 %, were explored. The final scores ranged between 0 and 5. Validation of the scores against results from the BVD surveillance programme 2013 gave promising results for setting the cut off for each of the five selected farm level criteria at the 50th percentile. Restricting testing to farms with a score >= 2 would have resulted in the same number of detected BVD positive farms as testing all farms, i.e., the outcome of the 2013 surveillance programme could have been reached with a smaller survey.Conclusions: The seasonality and time dependency of the activity of single farms in the networks requires a careful assessment of the actual time period included to determine farm level criteria. However, selecting farms in the sample for risk-based surveillance can be optimized with the proposed scoring system. The system was validated using data from the BVD eradication program. The proposed method is a promising framework for the selection of farms according to the risk of infection based on animal movements.",2015,BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH,11,,,10.1186/s12917-015-0468-8,#288,Schärrer 2015
Using an agent-based model to evaluate the effect of producer specialization on the epidemiological resilience of livestock production networks,"Wiltshire, SW","An agent-based computer model that builds representative regional U.S. hog production networks was developed and employed to assess the potential impact of the ongoing trend towards increased producer specialization upon network-level resilience to catastrophic disease outbreaks. Empirical analyses suggest that the spatial distribution and connectivity patterns of contact networks often predict epidemic spreading dynamics. Our model heuristically generates realistic systems composed of hog producer, feed mill, and slaughter plant agents. Network edges are added during each run as agents exchange livestock and feed. The heuristics governing agents' contact patterns account for factors including their industry roles, physical proximities, and the age of their livestock. In each run, an infection is introduced, and may spread according to probabilities associated with the various modes of contact. For each of three treatments-defined by one-phase, two-phase, and three-phase production systems-a parameter variation experiment examines the impact of the spatial density of producer agents in the system upon the length and size of disease outbreaks. Resulting data show phase transitions whereby, above some density threshold, systemic outbreaks become possible, echoing findings from percolation theory. Data analysis reveals that multi-phase production systems are vulnerable to catastrophic outbreaks at lower spatial densities, have more abrupt percolation transitions, and are characterized by less-predictable outbreak scales and durations. Key differences in network-level metrics shed light on these results, suggesting that the absence of potentially-bridging producer-producer edges may be largely responsible for the superior disease resilience of single-phase ""farrow to finish"" production systems.",2018,PLOS ONE,13,3,,10.1371/journal.pone.0194013,#289,Wiltshire 2018
Epidemic Spreading in an Animal Trade Network - Comparison of Distance-Based and Network-Based Control Measures,"Büttner, K; Krieter, J; Traulsen, A; Traulsen, I","This study considered a simple SIR model for the spread of epidemics amongst holdings of a producer community in Northern Germany, based on the directed network of animal movements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of different control measures to reduce the epidemic size substantially. The currently applied control measures based on the distance to an infected holding were compared with the control measures based on the specific network-based centrality parameters. We found that network-based measures led to a more efficient control of epidemics with a much smaller number of removed holdings. To assess the impact of different holding types, the analysed control measures were implemented by both including and excluding these holding types. The comparison revealed a crucial role of multipliers in the spread of an epidemic. The network-based control measures depending on the removal by out-degree, outgoing infection chain, betweenness centrality and outgoing closeness centrality showed the best results: In the three-year network, on average, 2.75, 4.15, 3.73 and 3.43 times more holdings had to be removed by the control measures based on the 1, 3, 5 and 10 km radius to reduce the epidemic to the same size compared with the network-based control measures. In an area with a higher holding density, the improvement of the network-based control measures may become even more obvious. The removal of holdings based on the above-mentioned centrality parameters did thus not only rapidly decompose the network into fragments, but also reduced the epidemic size most efficiently.",2016,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,63,1,E122-E134,10.1111/tbed.12245,#292,Büttner 2016
Social network analysis and risk assessment: An example of introducing an exotic animal disease in Italy,"Maurella, C; Mastrantonio, G; Bertolini, S; Crescio, MI; Ingravalle, F; Adkin, A; Simons, R; De Nardi, M; Estrada-Peña, A; Horigan, V; Ru, G","Exotic animal diseases are transboundary hazards, characterized by their capability to cover global distances, affecting animal health and welfare with significant economic losses. Their prevention is complex and requires the dynamic management of potential entry points, transmission pathways, and preventative barriers. The well-timed detection of an undefined or unexpected (exotic or re-emerging) threat could minimize the consequences due to onward transmission. As a fit for purpose framework, OIE developed the import risk assessment i.e. a risk assessment model focusing on the entrance of an exotic disease into a geographical area with naive hosts. In this paper, we propose an improvement of the model by integrating it with Social Network Analysis (SNA) accounting for within-country animal movements. Our integrated model has been used as a combined tool to better estimate the spatial probability of the introduction of at least one affected animal in Italian provinces using Bluetongue (BT) as an example. Starting from international country-specific BT prevalence data, the model estimated the probability of introduction to Italy via two different routes of release i.e. the import of infected animals or the release of infected vectors either associated with imported livestock or through windborne dispersion from Africa. The conventional OIE model estimating the probability of BT entering Italy assuming the same release probability for every Italian province was paralleled by a model integrated with outputs from SNA to account for different release probability among provinces based on animal movements. The conventional model predicted a remarkable homogeneity in the risk among the provinces with some peaks only visible during the warmest months. The model incorporating the network analysis predicted the highest risk to be in the North Eastern region of Italy but also highlighted the likely occurrence in a couple of Southern provinces, an output mirroring past occurrence of BT in Italy. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis highlighted the main role for a couple of model parameters i.e. the probability for a vector to become infected and the vaccine coverage, thus suggesting that an extra effort in vaccine campaigns could be envisaged. The ability to measure animal movements by SNA can allow the identification of geographical risk hot spots and therefore the risk-based targeting of the surveillance system.",2019,MICROBIAL RISK ANALYSIS,13,,,10.1016/j.mran.2019.04.001,#294,Maurella 2019
Detection of Infection Sources for Avian Influenza A(H7N9) in Live Poultry Transport Network During the Fifth Wave in China,"Pei, X; Jin, Z; Zhang, WY; Wang, Y","Numerous studies have demonstrated that exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets is the significant risk factor for human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9). However, the specific live poultry markets that are major infection sources for A(H7N9) human cases have not been explored in detail. In this study, we extract data associated with poultry farms, live poultry markets and farmers markets from Baidu Map using the JavaScript language and then construct the live poultry transport network. From this, we establish our A(H7N9) transmission model over the network based upon probabilistic discrete-time Markov chain. On the basis of the obtained network and model, we propose spatiotemporal backward detection and forward transmission algorithms to detect the most likely infection sources and to compute the first arrival times of the infection sources. Our simulations use these algorithms to identify the specific locations of the infection sources, the first arrival times of the infection sources and the most likely transmission map of the A(H7N9) virus along the live poultry transport network. The results reveal that, in addition to the hazards posed by the live poultry markets, backyard poultry also contributed to A(H7N9) human infections; this risk source was significant especially in the newly affected provinces, in the fifth wave of infection. In particular, by analyzing the temperature characteristics at a given location when the infection source arrived, we find that the risk of human infection with the influenza A(H7N9) virus was high under 9C19C; moderate under 0C9C or 19C25C; and low for temperatures 0C or 25C. Our results suggest that strengthening the supervision of the live poultry market system and immunizing poultry at both live poultry markets and the backyard poultry operations under the high risk temperature band of 9C19C, will be able to significantly contribute to the control of avian influenza A(H7N9) in the future.",2019,IEEE ACCESS,7,,155759-155778,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949606,#298,Pei 2019

Can Ingoing Contact Chains and other cattle movement network metrics help predict herd-level bovine tuberculosis in Irish cattle herds?,"Tratalos, JA; Fielding, HR; Madden, JM; Casey, M; More, SJ","We used logistic regression to investigate whether the risk of an Irish cattle herd undergoing a bovine tuberculosis (bTB) breakdown increased with the size of the Ingoing Contact Chain (ICC) of previous herd to herd cattle movements, in a sequence up to eight moves back from the most recent, direct, movement into the herd. We further examined whether taking into account the bTB test history of each herd in the chain would improve model fit. We found that measures of cattle movements directly into the herd were risk factors for subsequent bTB restrictions, and the number of herds that animals were coming from was the most important of these. However, in contrast to a previous study in Great Britain, the ICC herd count at steps more remote than direct movements into the herd did not result in better fitting models than restricting the count to direct movements. Restricting the ICC counts to herds which had previously or would in the future test positive for bTB resulted in improved model fits, but this was not the case if only the previous test status was considered. This suggests that in many cases bTB infected animals are moving out of herds before being identified through testing, and that risk based trading approaches should not rely solely on the previous test history of source herds as a proxy for future risk. Model fit was also improved by the inclusion of variables measuring bTB history of the herd, bTB in neighbouring herds, herd size, herd type, the movement network measures ""in strength"" and ""betweenness"", altitude, modelled badger abundance and county. Rainfall was not a good predictor. The most influential measures of bTB in nearby herds (a proxy for neighbourhood infection) were the proportion of herds with a history of bTB whose centroids were within 6 km, or whose boundaries were within 4 km, of the index herd. As well as informing national control and surveillance measures, our models can be used to identify areas where bTB rates are anomalously high, to prompt further investigation in these areas.",2023,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,211,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105816,#303,Tratalos 2023
"Assessing potential routes of<i> Streptococcus</i><i> agalactiae</i> transmission between dairy herds using national surveillance, animal movement data and molecular typing","Churakov, M; Katholm, J; Rogers, S; Kao, RR; Zadoks, RN","Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a pathogen of humans and animals. It is an important cause of mastitis in dairy cattle, causing decreased milk quality and quantity. Denmark is the only country to have implemented a national surveillance and control campaign for GBS in dairy cattle. After a significant decline in the 20th century, prevalence has increased in the 21st century. Using a unique combination of national surveillance, cattle movement data and molecular typing, we tested the hypothesis that transmission mechanisms differ between GBS strains that are almost exclusive to cattle and those that affect humans as well as cattle, which would have implications for control recommendations. Three types of S. agalactiae, sequence type (ST) 1, ST23 and ST103 were consistently the most frequent strains among isolates obtained through the national surveillance programme from 2009 to 2011. Herds infected with ST103, which is common in cattle but rarely found in people in Europe, were spatially clustered throughout the study period and across spatial scales. By contrast, strains that are also commonly found in humans, ST1 and ST23, showed no spatial clustering in most or any years of the study, respectively. Introduction of cattle from a positive herd was associated with increased risk of infection by S. agalactiae in the next year (risk ratio of 2.9 and 4.7 for 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, respectively). Moreover, mean exposure to infection was significantly higher for newly infected herds and significantly lower for persistently susceptible herds, as compared to random simulated networks with the same properties, which suggests strong association between the cattle movement network and new infections. At strain-level, new infections with ST1 between 2009 and 2010 were significantly associated with cattle movements, while other strains showed only some degree of association. Sharing of veterinary services, which may serve as proxy for local or regional contacts at a range of scales, was not significantly associated with increased risk of introduction of S. agalactiae or one of the three predominant strains on a farm. Our findings support the reinstatement of restrictions on cattle movements from S. agalactiae positive herds, which came into effect in 2018, but provide insufficient evidence to support strain-specific control recommendations.",2021,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,197,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105501,#310,Churakov 2021
Evaluating empirical contact networks as potential transmission pathways for infectious diseases,"VanderWaal, K; Enns, EA; Picasso, C; Packer, C; Craft, ME","Networks are often used to incorporate heterogeneity in contact patterns in mathematical models of pathogen spread. However, few tools exist to evaluate whether potential transmission pathways in a population are adequately represented by an observed contact network. Here, we describe a novel permutation-based approach, the network k-test, to determine whether the pattern of cases within the observed contact network are likely to have resulted from transmission processes in the network, indicating that the network represents potential transmission pathways between nodes. Using simulated data of pathogen spread, we compare the power of this approach to other commonly used analytical methods. We test the robustness of this technique across common sampling constraints, including undetected cases, unobserved individuals and missing interaction data. We also demonstrate the application of this technique in two case studies of livestock and wildlife networks. We show that the power of the k-test to correctly identify the epidemiologic relevance of contact networks is substantially greater than other methods, even when 50% of contact or case data are missing. We further demonstrate that the impact of missing data on network analysis depends on the structure of the network and the type of missing data.",2016,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE,13,121,,10.1098/rsif.2016.0166,#314,VanderWaal 2016
Patterns of contact within the New Zealand poultry industry,"Lockhart, CY; Stevenson, MA; Rawdon, TG; Gerber, N; French, NP","Members of the Poultry Industry Association and the Egg Producers Federation of New Zealand (n = 420) were sent a questionnaire asking them to describe the type and frequency of on- and off-enterprise movements relating to feed, live birds and hatching eggs, table eggs and poultry product, and manure and waste litter. Social network analyses were used to describe patterns of contact among poultry enterprises and their associates for these four movement types. The response rate to the survey was 58% (244 out of 420). Network structures for enterprise-to-enterprise movements of feed, live birds and hatching eggs, and table egg and poultry product were characterised by 'hub and spoke' type structures with small-world characteristics. Small worlds were created by network hubs (e.g. feed suppliers and hatcheries) providing goods and services to larger numbers of client farms. In addition to hubs acting as the predominant source of material moving onto farms we identified enterprises acting as bridges between identified small worlds. The presence of these bridges is a concern, since their presence has the potential to facilitate the spread of hazards (e.g. feed contaminants, infectious agents carried within feed) more readily throughout the population. An ability to predict enterprises with these network characteristics on the basis of factors such as shed capacity, enterprise type, geographic location would be useful for developing risk-based approaches to disease prevention, surveillance, detection, response and control activities.

Unravelling direct and indirect contact patterns between duck farms in France and their association with the 2016-2017 epidemic of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N8),"Bauzile, B; Sicard, G; Guinat, C; Andraud, M; Rose, N; Hammami, P; Durand, B; Paul, MC; Vergne, T","Live animal movements generate direct contacts (via the exchange of live animals) and indirect contacts (via the transit of transport vehicles) between farms, which can contribute to the spread of pathogens. However, most analyses focus solely on direct contacts and can therefore underestimate the contribution of live animal movements in the spread of infectious diseases. Here, we used French live duck movement data (2016-2018) from one of the largest transport companies to compare direct and indirect contact patterns between duck farms and evaluate how these patterns were associated with the French 2016-2017 epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8. A total number of 614 farms were included in the study, and two directed networks were generated: the animal introduction network (exchange of live ducks) and the transit network (transit of transport vehicles). Following descriptive analyses, these two networks were scrutinized in relation to farm infection status during the epidemic. Results showed that farms were substantially more connected in the transit network than in the animal introduction network and that the transit of transport vehicles generated more opportunities for transmission than the exchange of live animals. We also showed that animal introduction and transit networks' statistics decreased substantially during the epidemic (January-March 2017) compared to non-epidemic periods (January-March 2016 and January-March 2018). We estimated a probability of 33.3 % that a farm exposed to the infection through either of the two live duck movement networks (i.e. that was in direct or indirect contact with a farm that was reported as infected in the following seven days) becomes infected within seven days after the contact. However, we also demonstrated that the level of exposure of farms by these two contact patterns was low, leading only to a handful of transmission events through these routes. As a consequence, we showed that live animal movement patterns are efficient transmission routes for HPAI but have been efficiently reduced to limit the spread during the French 2020-2021 epidemic. These results underpin the relevance of studying indirect contacts resulting from the movement of animals to understand their transmission potential and the importance of accounting for both routes when designing disease control strategies.",2022,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,198,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105548,#325,Bauzile 2022
Relative contributions of neighbourhood and animal movements to <i>Coxiella burnetii</i> infection in dairy cattle herds,"Nusinovici, S; Hoch, T; Widgren, S; Joly, A; Lindberg, A; Beaudeau, F","Q fever in dairy cattle herds occurs mainly after inhalation of contaminated aerosols generated from excreta by shedder animals. Propagation of Coxiella burnetii, the cause of the disease between ruminant herds could result from transmission between neighbouring herds and/or the introduction of infected shedder animals in healthy herds. The objective of this study were (i) to describe the spatial distribution C. burnetii-infected dairy cattle herds in two different regions: the Finistere District in France (2,829 herds) and the island of Gotland in Sweden (119 herds) and (ii) to quantify and compare the relative contributions of C. burnetii transmission related to neighbourhood and to animal movements on the risk for a herd to be infected. An enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay was used for testing bulk tank milk in May 2012 and June 2011, respectively. Only one geographical cluster of positive herds was identified in north-western Finistere. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of risk for a herd to test positively with local cattle density (the total number of cattle located in a 5 km radius circle) and the in-degree (ID) parameter, a measure of the number of herds from which each herd had received animals directly within the last 2 years. The risk for a herd to test positively was higher for herds with a higher local cattle density [odds ratio (OR) = 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.6-3.2, for herds with a local density between 100 and 120 compared to herds with a local density 60]. The risk was also higher for herds with higher IDs (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.6-3.2, for herds with ID 3 compared to herds that did not introduce animals). The proportion of cases attributable to infections in the neighbourhood in high-density areas was twice the proportion attributable to animal movements, suggesting that wind plays a main role in the transmission.",2014,GEOSPATIAL HEALTH,8,2,471-477,10.4081/gh.2014.36,#326,Nusinovici 2014

Animal Movements and FMDV Transmission during the High-Risk Period of the 2001 FMD Epidemic in Uruguay,"Iriarte, MV; Gonzales, JL; Gil, AD; de Jong, MCM","During the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Uruguay, many farms were already infected and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) had spread throughout the country by the time the first outbreak was detected and a ban on animal movements was implemented. Before this ban, movements of infected animals between livestock premises were probably one of the main factors contributing to the spread of the disease. Understanding and quantifying this contribution allow identifying risk premises or risk areas to help policymakers to implement effective interventions and enhance targeted surveillance. The aim of this study was to describe, visualize, and analyze the network of livestock movements between livestock premises during the initial phase of the 2001 FMD epidemic in Uruguay and gain insight into the risk of transmission by estimating the between herd basic reproduction number (RH) before a ban on animal movements was implemented. Here, we derived RH from the average number of outcontacts of infected premises and the average probability that a contact leads to infection. Additionally, we analyzed the current (2022) network of livestock movements in Uruguay, for the same period as in 2001, and estimated RH assuming the same probability of infection as in 2001. We found that the movements of infected animals during the high-risk period of this epidemic-i.e., the period between FMDV introduction and the detection of the index case-had an important contribution to the virus spread among premises (RH = 1.48). Livestock markets and highly connected farms were responsible for the early long-distance spread of FMDV. The analysis of the 2022 network shows that this network is similar to that of 2001 and highlights the importance of targeting highly connected premises, particularly livestock markets, for surveillance, target early detection, and implement interventions during epidemics.",2023,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,2023,,,10.1155/2023/8883502,#329,Iriarte 2023
Epidemiological modelling for the assessment of bovine tuberculosis surveillance in the dairy farm network in Emilia-Romagna (Italy),"Rossi, G; De Leo, GA; Pongolini, S; Natalini, S; Vincenzi, S; Bolzoni, L","Assessing the performance of a surveillance system for infectious diseases of domestic animals is a challenging task for health authorities. Therefore, it is important to assess what strategy is the most effective in identifying the onset of an epidemic and in minimizing the number of infected farms.The aim of the present work was to evaluate the performance of the bovine tuberculosis (bTB) surveillance system in the network of dairy farms in the Emilia-Romagna (ER) Region, Italy. A bTB-free Region since 2007, ER implements an integrated surveillance strategy based on three components, namely routine on-farm tuberculin skin-testing performed every 3 years, tuberculin skin-testing of cattle exchanged between farms, and post-mortem inspection at slaughterhouses. We assessed the effectiveness of surveillance by means of a stochastic network model of both within-farm and between-farm bTB dynamics calibrated on data available for ER dairy farms. Epidemic dynamics were simulated for five scenarios: the current ER surveillance system, a no surveillance scenario that we used as the benchmark to characterize epidemic dynamics, three additional scenarios in which one of the surveillance components was removed at a time so as to outline its significance in detecting the infection. For each scenario we ran Monte Carlo simulations of bTB epidemics following the random introduction of an infected individual in the network. System performances were assessed through the comparative analysis of a number of statistics, including the time required for epidemic detection and the total number of infected farms during the epidemic.Our analysis showed that slaughterhouse inspection is the most effective surveillance component in reducing the time for disease detection, while routine surveillance in reducing the number of multi-farms epidemics. On the other hand, testing exchanged cattle improved the performance of the surveillance system only marginally. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Demographic structure and pathogen dynamics on the network of livestock movements in Great Britain,"Kao, RR; Danon, L; Green, DM; Kiss, IZ","Using a novel interpretation of dynamic networks, we analyse the network of livestock movements in Great Britain in order to determine the risk of a large epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). This network is exceptionally well characterized, as there are legal requirements that the date, source, destination and number of animals be recorded and held on central databases. We identify a percolation threshold in the structure of the livestock network, indicating that, while there is little possibility of a national epidemic of FMD in winter when the catastrophic 2001 epidemic began, there remains a risk in late summer or early autumn. These predictions are corroborated by a non-parametricsimulation in which the movements of livestock in 2003 and 2004 are replayed as they occurred. Despite the risk, we show that the network displays small-world properties which can be exploited to target surveillance and control and drastically reduce this risk.",2006,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,273,1597,1999-2007,10.1098/rspb.2006.3505,#336,Kao 2006
Contact chains of cattle farms in Great Britain,"Fielding, HR; McKinley, TJ; Silk, MJ; Delahay, RJ; McDonald, RA","Network analyses can assist in predicting the course of epidemics. Time-directed paths or 'contact chains' provide a measure of host-connectedness across specified timeframes, and so represent potential pathways for spread of infections with different epidemiological characteristics. We analysed networks and contact chains of cattle farms in Great Britain using Cattle Tracing System data from 2001 to 2015. We focused on the potential for between-farm transmission of bovine tuberculosis, a chronic infection with potential for hidden spread through the network. Networks were characterized by scale-free type properties, where individual farms were found to be influential 'hubs' in the network. We found a markedly bimodal distribution of farms with either small or very large ingoing and outgoing contact chains (ICCs and OCCs). As a result of their cattle purchases within 12-month periods, 47% of British farms were connected by ICCs to more than 1000 other farms and 16% were connected to more than 10 000 other farms. As a result of their cattle sales within 12-month periods, 66% of farms had OCCs that reached more than 1000 other farms and 15% reached more than 10 000 other farms. Over 19 000 farms had both ICCs and OCCs reaching more than 10 000 farms for two or more years. While farms with more contacts in their ICCs or OCCs might play an important role in disease spread, farms with extensive ICCs and OCCs might be particularly important by being at higher risk of both acquiring and disseminating infections.",2019,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,6,2,,10.1098/rsos.180719,#341,Fielding 2019
"Investigation of the Occurrence of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Virus in Swine Herds Participating in an Area Regional Control and Elimination Project in Ontario, Canada","Arruda, AG; Friendship, R; Carpenter, J; Hand, K; Ojkic, D; Poljak, Z","The main goal of this study was to investigate the occurrence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-specific genotypes in swine sites in Ontario (Canada) using molecular, spatial and network data from a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) regional control project. For each site, location, animal movement service provider (truck companies), PRRSV status and sequencing data of the open reading frame 5 (ORF5) were obtained. Three-kilometre buffers were created to evaluate neighbourhood characteristics for each site. Social network analysis was conducted on swine sites and trucking companies to assemble the network and define network components. Three different PRRSV genotypes were used as outcomes for statistical analysis based on the region's phylogenetic tree of the ORF5. Multivariable exact logistic regression was conducted to investigate the association between being positive for a specific genotype and two main exposures of interest: (i) having at least one neighbour within three km also positive for the same genotype outside the production system and (ii) having at least one positive site for the same genotype in the same truck network component outside the production system. Results showed that the importance of area spread and truck network on PRRSV occurrence differed according to genotype. Additionally, the Ontario PRRS database appears suitable for conducting regional disease investigations. Finally, the use of relatively new tools available for network, spatial and molecular analysis could be useful in investigation, control and prevention of endemic infectious diseases in animal populations.",2017,TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES,64,1,89-100,10.1111/tbed.12343,#342,Arruda 2017
An investigation of transportation practices in an Ontario swine system using descriptive network analysis,"Melmer, DJ; O'Sullivan, TL; Greer, AL; Poljak, Z","The objectives of this research were to describe the contact structure of transportation vehicles and swine facilities in an Ontario swine production system, and to assess their potential contribution to possible disease transmission over different time periods. A years' worth of data (2015) was obtained from a large swine production and data management company located in Ontario, Canada. There was a total of 155 different transportation vehicles, and 220 different farms within the study population. Two-mode networks were constructed for 1-,3-, and 7-day time periods over the entire year and were analyzed. Trends in the size of the maximum weak component and outgoing contact chain over discrete time periods were investigated using linear regression. Additionally, the number of different types of facilities with betweenness >0 and in/out degree>0 were analyzed using Poisson regression. Maximum weekly outgoing contact chain (MOCCw) contained between 2.1% and 7.1% of the study population. This suggests a potential maximum of disease spread within this population if the disease was detected within one week. Frequency of node types within MOCCw showed considerable variability; although nursery sites were relatively most frequent. The regression analysis of several node and network level statistics indicated a potential peak time of connectivity during the summer months and warrants further confirmation and investigation. The inclusion of transportation vehicles contributed to the linear increase in the maximum weekly weak component (MWCw) size over time. This finding in combination with constant population dynamics, may have been driven by the differential utilization of trucks over time. Despite known limitations of maximum weak components as an estimator of possible outbreaks, this finding suggests that transportation vehicles should be included, when possible and relevant, in the evaluation of contacts between farms.",2020,PLOS ONE,15,1,,10.1371/journal.pone.0226813,#344,Melmer 2020

Dairy cattle may be moved between farms over long distances, and hence understanding the route and frequency of the movements is essential to establish the pattern of spread of BTB between farms, which could ultimately help to inform policy makers to design cost effective control strategies. The objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the network structure of dairy cattle movement and its influence on the transmission and prevalence of BTB in three emerging areas among the Ethiopian dairy belts, namely the cities of Hawassa, Gondar and Mekelle.MethodsA questionnaire survey was conducted in 278 farms to collect data on the pattern of dairy cattle movement for the last 5years (September 2013 to August 2018). Visualization of the network structure and analysis of the relationship between the network patterns and the prevalence of BTB in these regions were made using social network analysis.ResultsThe cattle movement network structure display both scale free and small world properties implying local clustering with fewer farms being highly connected, at higher risk of infection, with the potential to act as super spreaders of BTB if infected. Farms having a history of cattle movements onto the herds were more likely to be affected by BTB (OR: 2.2) compared to farms not having a link history. Euclidean distance between farms and the batch size of animals moved on were positively correlated with prevalence of BTB. On the other hand, farms having one or more outgoing cattle showed a decrease on the likelihood of BTB infection (OR=0.57) compared to farms which maintained their cattle.ConclusionThis study showed that the patterns of cattle movement and size of animal moved between farms contributed to the potential for BTB transmission. The few farms with the bulk of transmission potential could be efficiently targeted by control measures aimed at reducing the spread of BTB. The network structure described can also provide the starting point to build and estimate dynamic transmission models for BTB, and other infectious diseases.",2019,BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH,15,,,10.1186/s12917-019-1962-1,#345,ETHICOBOTSConsortium 2019
Modeling cost-effectiveness of risk-based bovine tuberculosis surveillance in Minnesota,"Kao, SYZ; VanderWaal, K; Enns, EA; Craft, ME; Alvarez, J; Picasso, C; Wells, SJ","In the United States, slaughter surveillance combined with other measures has effectively maintained a very low prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (bTB). However, bTB continues to be sporadically detected, causing substantial economic burden to the government and cattle producers. To detect the infection earlier and reduce sudden economic losses, additional risk-based surveillance of live animals might be more cost-effective than slaughter surveillance alone to detect and prevent bTB infection. The objective of this study was to evaluate alternative risk-based surveillance strategies targeting high-risk herds to complement slaughter surveillance in a region with very low bTB prevalence. We developed an integrated within- and between-herd bTB transmission model with simulated premises-level cattle movements among beef and dairy herds in Minnesota for 10 years. We constructed ten risk-based surveillance strategies for beef herds and dairy herds, and predicted the epidemiological outcomes and costs for each strategy in combination with slaughter surveillance. Our models showed that slaughter surveillance alone resulted in low risk of between-herd transmission with typically small outbreak sizes, and also cost less compared to alternative risk-based surveillance measures. However, risk-based surveillance strategies could reduce the time to detect infection and the time to reach disease freedom by up to 9 months. At a higher initial prevalence, alternative risk-based surveillance could reduce the number of infected herds and shorten the time to disease freedom by almost 3 years (34-35 months). Our findings suggest that risk-based surveillance could detect infection more quickly and allow affected regions to reach disease freedom faster. If the bTB status of the affected regions changes after an outbreak happens, the reduced time to disease freedom could reduce the economic impact on the affected region.",2018,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,159,,11-Jan,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.08.011,#347,Kao 2018
Animal movement in a pastoralist population in the Maasai Mara Ecosystem in Kenya and implications for pathogen spread and control,"Omondi, GP; Obanda, V; VanderWaal, K; Deen, J; Travis, DA","Livestock movements are important drivers for infectious disease transmission. However, paucity of such data in pastoralist communities in rangeland ecosystems limits our understanding of their dynamics and hampers disease surveillance and control. The aim of this study was to investigate animal movement networks in a pastoralist community in Kenya, and assess network-based strategies for disease control. We used network analysis to characterize five types of between-village animal movement networks. We then evaluated implications of these networks for disease spread and control by quantifying topological changes in the network associated with targeted and random removal of nodes. To construct these networks, data were collected using standardized questionnaires (N = 165 households) from communities living within the Maasai Mara Ecosystem in southwestern Kenya. Our analyses show that the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR), a protected wildlife area, was critical for maintaining village connectivity in the agistment network (dry season grazing), with MMNRadjacent villages being highly utilized during the dry season. In terms of disease dynamics, the network-based basic reproduction number, R0, was sufficient to allow disease invasion in all the five networks, and removal of villages based on degree or betweenness was not efficient in reducing R0. However, we show that villages with high degree or betweenness may play an important role in maintaining network connectivity, which may not be captured by assessment of R0 alone. Such villages may function as potential ?firebreaks.? For example, targeted removal of highly connected village nodes was more effective at fragmenting each network than random removal of nodes, indicating that network-based targeting of interventions such as vaccination could potentially disrupt transmission pathways in the ecosystem. In conclusion, this work shows that animal movements have the potential to shape patterns of disease transmission in this ecosystem, with targeted interventions being a practical and efficient measure for disease control.",2021,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,188,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105259,#351,Omondi 2021

In this study, we designed the nodes as groups of persons or places involved in activities relating to backyard chickens. The ties are all activities related to the nodes. The study applied a partial network approach to assess the spreading pattern of avian influenza. From 557 questionnaires collected from the nodes, the researchers found that the degree (the numbers of ties that a node has) and closeness (the distance from one node to the others) centralities of Nakhon Pathom were significantly higher than those of the others (P<0.001). The results show that compared with the remaining areas, this area is more quickly connected to many links. If the avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 was released into the network, the disease would spread throughout this province more rapidly than in Ratchaburi and Suphan Buri. The betweenness centrality in each of these provinces showed no differences (P>0.05). In this study, the nodes that play an important role in all networks are farmers who raise consumable chicken, farmers who raise both consumable chicken and fighting cocks, farmers' households that connect with dominant nodes, and the owners and observers of fighting cocks at arenas and training fields. In this study, we did not find cut points or blocks in the network. Moreover, we detected a random network in all provinces. Thus, connectivity between the nodes covers long or short distances, with less predictable behaviour.

Analysis of traditional poultry trader networks to improve risk-based surveillance,"Vallée, E; Waret-Szkuta, A; Chaka, H; Duboz, R; Balcha, M; Goutard, F","Live bird markets and contacts between them through poultry traders are known risk factors in the spread of diseases such as Newcastle disease. A traders' questionnaire survey was used to build networks of chicken movements among 29 shared markets during and outside festive seasons in the Oromia region of Ethiopia. A comparison was made between typologies built using centrality indexes (in-degree, out-degree, in-closeness, out-closeness and random-walk betweenness) and descriptive characteristics of the markets (number of chickens, number and type of sellers and the frequency with which they use different markets). The festive seasons did not appear to have an impact on the network structure, implying that it was not necessary to make structural changes to surveillance targets during these periods. Based on centrality indices, three markets (Meki, Debre Zeit and Adulala) emerged from the typology as being central to the network, which would not have been deduced from their descriptive characteristics alone.

Approximately 0.2% of live-duck movements could have been responsible for between-farm transmission events, mostly early during the epidemic. Results also suggest a transmission risk of 35.5% when an infected holding moves flocks to another holding within 14 days before detection.

Recently, a growing number of layer farms have been heavily damaged from the HPAIv epidemic due to the increased virulence of the virus and the intensification of the production system. Therefore, stakeholders should implement effective preventive practices at the farm level that are aligned with contingency measures at the national level to minimize poultry losses. However, numerous biosecurity protocols for layer farm workers to follow have been developed, impeding efficient prevention and control. Furthermore, the effectiveness of biosecurity practices varies with the geographical condition and inter-farm contact structures. Hence, the objective of our study was to examine the preventive effect of five biosecurity actions commonly practiced at layer farms in the Republic of Korea against HPAIv H5N6: (i) fence installation around a farm, ii) rodent control inside a farm; iii) disinfection booth for visitors for disinfection protocols, iv) an anterior room in the sheds before entering the bird area and v) boots changes when moving between sheds in the same farm. We conducted a case-control study on 114 layer case farms and 129 layer control farms during the 2016-17 HPAI epidemic. The odds ratios for five on-farm biosecurity practices implemented in those study groups were estimated as a preventive effect on the HPAI infection with covariates, including seven geographical conditions and three network metrics using Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression and geographical location weighted logistic regression. The results showed that the use of a disinfection booth for personnel reduced the odds of HPAIv H5N6 infection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.002, 95 % credible interval [CrI] = 0.00007 - 0.025) with relatively small spatial variation (minimum AOR - maximum AOR: 0.084-0.263). Changing boots between sheds on the same farm reduced the odds of HPAIv H5N6 infection (AOR = 0.160, 95 % CrI = 0.024-0.852) with relatively wide spatial variation (minimum AOR - maximum AOR = 0.270-0.688). Therefore, enhanced personnel biosecurity protocols at the farm of entry for layer farms is recommended to effectively prevent and respond to HPAIv H5N6 infection under different local condition. Our study provides an important message for layer farmers to effectively implement on-farm biosecurity actions against HPAIv H5N6 infection at their farms by setting priorities based on their spatial condition and network position.",2022,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,199,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105556,#371,Yoo 2022
Generation of swine movement network and analysis of efficient mitigation strategies for African swine fever virus,"Ferdousi, T; Moon, SA; Self, A; Scoglio, C","Animal movement networks are essential in understanding and containing the spread of infectious diseases in farming industries. Due to its confidential nature, movement data for the US swine farming population is not readily available. Hence, we propose a method to generate such networks from limited data available in the public domain. As a potentially devastating candidate, we simulate the spread of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in our generated network and analyze how the network structure affects the disease spread. We find that high in-degree farm operations (i.e., markets) play critical roles in the disease spread. We also find that high in-degree based targeted isolation and hypothetical vaccinations are more effective for disease control compared to other centrality-based mitigation strategies. The generated networks can be made more robust by validation with more data whenever more movement data will be available.",2019,PLOS ONE,14,12,,10.1371/journal.pone.0225785,#380,Ferdousi 2019
"Analysis of cattle movements in Argentina, 2005","Aznar, MN; Stevenson, MA; Zarich, L; León, EA","We describe the movement of cattle throughout Argentina in 2005. Details of farm-to-farm and farm-to-slaughter movements of cattle were obtained from the Sanitary Management System database (Sistema de Gestion Sanitaria, SGS), maintained by the National Service for Agrifood Health and Quality (SENASA). Movements were described at the regional and district level in terms of frequency, the number of stock transported, the district of origin and destination and Euclidean distance traveled. Social network analysis was used to characterize the connections made between regions and districts as a result of cattle movement transactions, and to show how these characteristics might influence disease spread.Throughout 2005 a total of 1.3 million movement events involving 32 million head of cattle (equivalent to approximately 57% of the national herd) were recorded in the SGS database. The greatest number of farm-to-farm movements occurred from April to June whereas numbers of farm-to-slaughter movement events were relatively constant throughout the year. Throughout 2005 there was a 1.1-1.6-fold increase in the number of farm-to-farm movements of cattle during April-June, compared with other times of the year. District in-degree and out-degree scores varied by season, with higher maximum scores during the autumn and winter compared with summer and spring. Districts with high in-degree scores were concentrated in the Finishing region of the country whereas districts with high out-degree scores were concentrated not only in the Finishing region but also in Mesopotamia, eastern Border and southern Central regions. Although movements of cattle from the Border region tended not to be mediated via markets, the small number of districts in this area with relatively high out-degree scores is a cause for concern as they have the potential to distribute infectious disease widely, in the event of an incursion.

Quantifying changes in the British cattle movement network,"Duncan, AJ; Reeves, A; Gunn, GJ; Humphry, RW","The modelling of disease spread is crucial to the farming industry and policy makers. In some of these industries, excellent data exist on animal movements, along with the networks that these movements create, and allow researchers to model spread of disease (both epidemic and endemic). The Cattle Tracing System is an online recording system for cattle births, deaths and between-herd movements in the United Kingdom and is an excellent resource for any researchers interested in networks or modelling infectious disease spread through the UK cattle system. Data exist that cover many years, and it can be useful to know how much change is occurring in a network, to help judge the merit of using historical data within a modelling context. This article uses the data to construct weighted directed monthly movement networks for two distinct periods of time, 2004-2006 and 2015-2017, to quantify by how much the underlying structure of the network has changed. Substantial changes in network structure may influence policy-makers directly or may influence models built upon the network data, and these in turn could impact policy-makers and their assessment of risk. We examined 13 network metrics, ranging from general descriptive metrics such as total number of nodes with movements and total movements, through to metrics to describe the network (e.g., Giant weakly and strongly connected components) and metrics calculated per node (betweenness, degree and strength). Mixed effect models show that there is a statistically significant effect of the period (2004-2006 vs 2015-2017) in the values of nine of the 13 network metrics. For example median total degree decreased by 19%. In addition to examining networks for two time periods, two updates of the data were examined to determine by how much the movement data stored for 2004-2006 had been cleansed between updates. Examination of these updates shows that there are small decreases in problem movements (such as animals leaving slaughterhouses) and therefore evidence of historical data being improved between updates. In combination with the significant effect of period on many of the network metrics, the modification of data between updates provides further evidence that the most recent available data should be used for network modelling. This will ensure that the most representative descriptions of the network are available to provide accurate modelling results to best inform policy makers.",2022,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,198,,,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105524,#397,Duncan 2022
Tracking Socioeconomic Vulnerability Using Network Analysis: Insights from an Avian Influenza Outbreak in an Ostrich Production Network,"Moore, C; Cumming, GS; Slingsby, J; Grewar, J","Background: The focus of management in many complex systems is shifting towards facilitation, adaptation, building resilience, and reducing vulnerability. Resilience management requires the development and application of general heuristics and methods for tracking changes in both resilience and vulnerability. We explored the emergence of vulnerability in the South African domestic ostrich industry, an animal production system which typically involves 3-4 movements of each bird during its lifetime. This system has experienced several disease outbreaks, and the aim of this study was to investigate whether these movements have contributed to the vulnerability of this system to large disease outbreaks.Methodology/Principal Findings: The ostrich production system requires numerous movements of birds between different farm types associated with growth (i.e. Hatchery to juvenile rearing farm to adult rearing farm). We used 5 years of movement records between 2005 and 2011 prior to an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N2). These data were analyzed using a network analysis in which the farms were represented as nodes and the movements of birds as links. We tested the hypothesis that increasing economic efficiency in the domestic ostrich industry in South Africa made the system more vulnerable to outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N2). Our results indicated that as time progressed, the network became increasingly vulnerable to pathogen outbreaks. The farms that became infected during the outbreak displayed network qualities, such as significantly higher connectivity and centrality, which predisposed them to be more vulnerable to disease outbreak.Conclusions/Significance: Taken in the context of previous research, our results provide strong support for the application of network analysis to track vulnerability, while also providing useful practical implications for system monitoring and management.",2014,PLOS ONE,9,1,,10.1371/journal.pone.0086973,#398,Moore 2014
Use of social network analysis to characterize the pattern of animal movements in the initial phases of the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in the UK,"Ortiz-Pelaez, A; Pfeiffer, DU; Soares-Magalhaes, RJ; Guitian, FJ","Aggregated movement data do not take into account the relative position of the units within a higher-level structure. Social network analysis (SNA) and graph theory provide a tool to organise and analyse relational data overcoming the limitations of standard methods where the position of individuals/observations does not affect the result of the analysis.Some recorded movements of cattle and sheep during the initial phase of the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in the UK, before the ban on animal movements was imposed, are analysed descriptively using SNA. With the data available, a directed dichotomized network with 653 nodes and 797 arches was analysed. Most of the 10 nodes with the highest betweenness (3 farms, 4 markets and 3 dealers) were identified as key players in the initial spread of the infection. Three groups of nodes with distinctive proportion of k <= 2 neighbours would result in three different theoretical outbreak dimension, assuming that the infection is only disseminated by he movement, included in the network: no spread, spread up to 7% and around 25%.There are three hierarchical clusters with 308, 215 and 130 nodes, respectively. Farms in cluster I appear to be more similar in their movement patterns to non-farm holdings than to farms in clusters 2 and 3.Relative betweenness, k-neighbours and structural equivalence using hierarchical clustering were able to identify key actors in the evolution of the initial phases of the FMD outbreak such as markets, dealers and farms with atypical movement patterns. Holdings with high betweenness, large number of k <= 2 neighbours and with movement pattern as in cluster I should be targeted in disease control activities once primary actors like markets, dealers and slaughter houses have been contained.

Disease persistence on temporal contact networks accounting for heterogeneous infectious periods,"Darbon, A; Colombi, D; Valdano, E; Savini, L; Giovannini, A; Colizza, V","The infectious period of a transmissible disease is a key factor for disease spread and persistence. Epidemic models on networks typically assume an identical average infectious period for all individuals, thus allowing an analytical treatment. This simplifying assumption is, however, often unrealistic, as hosts may have different infectious periods, due, for instance, to individual host-pathogen interactions or inhomogeneous access to treatment. While previous work accounted for this heterogeneity in static networks, a full theoretical understanding of the interplay of varying infectious periods and time-evolving contacts is still missing. Here, we consider a susceptible-infectious-susceptible epidemic on a temporal network with host-specific average infectious periods, and develop an analytical framework to estimate the epidemic threshold, i.e. the critical transmissibility for disease spread in the host population. Integrating contact data for transmission with outbreak data and epidemiological estimates, we apply our framework to three real-world case studies exploring different epidemic contexts-the persistence of bovine tuberculosis in southern Italy, the spread of nosocomial infections in a hospital, and the diffusion of pandemic influenza in a school. We find that the homogeneous parametrization may cause important biases in the assessment of the epidemic risk of the host population. Our approach is also able to identify groups of hosts mostly responsible for disease diffusion who may be targeted for prevention and control, aiding public health interventions.",2019,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,6,1,,10.1098/rsos.181404,#406,Darbon 2019

Optimal surveillance strategies for bovine tuberculosis in a low-prevalence country,"VanderWaal, K; Enns, EA; Picasso, C; Alvarez, J; Perez, A; Fernandez, F; Gil, A; Craft, M; Wells, S","Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic disease of cattle that is difficult to control and eradicate in part due to the costly nature of surveillance and poor sensitivity of diagnostic tests. Like many countries, bTB prevalence in Uruguay has gradually declined to low levels due to intensive surveillance and control efforts over the past decades. In low prevalence settings, broad-based surveillance strategies based on routine testing may not be the most cost-effective way for controlling between-farm bTB transmission, while targeted surveillance aimed at high-risk farms may be more efficient for this purpose. To investigate the efficacy of targeted surveillance, we developed an integrated within-and between-farm bTB transmission model utilizing data from Uruguay's comprehensive animal movement database. A genetic algorithm was used to fit uncertain parameter values, such as the animal-level sensitivity of skin testing and slaughter inspection, to observed bTB epidemiological data. Of ten alternative surveillance strategies evaluated, a strategy based on eliminating testing in low-risk farms resulted in a 40% reduction in sampling effort without increasing bTB incidence. These results can inform the design of more cost-effective surveillance programs to detect and control bTB in Uruguay and other countries with low bTB prevalence.",2017,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,7,,,10.1038/s41598-017-04466-2,#412,VanderWaal 2017
A New Weighted Degree Centrality Measure: The Application in an Animal Disease Epidemic,"Candeloro, L; Savini, L; Conte, A","In recent years researchers have investigated a growing number of weighted heterogeneous networks, where connections are not merely binary entities, but are proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements. Different degree centrality measures have been proposed for this kind of networks. In this work we propose weighted degree and strength centrality measures (WDC and WSC). Using a reducing factor we correct classical centrality measures (CD) to account for tie weights distribution. The bigger the departure from equal weights distribution, the greater the reduction. These measures are applied to a real network of Italian livestock movements as an example. A simulation model has been developed to predict disease spread into Italian regions according to animal movements and animal population density. Model's results, expressed as infected regions and number of times a region gets infected, were related to weighted and classical degree centrality measures. WDC and WSC were shown to be more efficient in predicting node's risk and vulnerability. The proposed measures and their application in an animal network could be used to support surveillance and infection control strategy plans.",2016,PLOS ONE,11,11,,10.1371/journal.pone.0165781,#441,Candeloro 2016
"The pig transport network in Switzerland: Structure, patterns, and implications for the transmission of infectious diseases between animal holdings.","Sterchi, Martin; Faverjon, Celine; Sarasua, Cristina; Vargas, Maria Elena; Berezowski, John; Bernstein, Abraham; Grutter, Rolf; Nathues, Heiko","The topology of animal transport networks contributes substantially to how fast and to what extent a disease can transmit between animal holdings. Therefore, public authorities in many countries mandate livestock holdings to report all movements of animals. However, the reported data often does not contain information about the exact sequence of transports, making it impossible to assess the effect of truck sharing and truck contamination on disease transmission. The aim of this study was to analyze the topology of the Swiss pig transport network by means of social network analysis and to assess the implications for disease transmission between animal holdings. In particular, we studied how additional information about transport sequences changes the topology of the contact network. The study is based on the official animal movement database in Switzerland and a sample of transport data from one transport company. The results show that the Swiss pig transport network is highly fragmented, which mitigates the risk of a large-scale disease outbreak. By considering the time sequence of transports, we found that even in the worst case, only 0.34% of all farm-pairs were connected within one month. However, both network connectivity and individual connectedness of farms increased if truck sharing and especially truck contamination were considered. Therefore, the extent to which a disease may be transmitted between animal holdings may be underestimated if we only consider data from the official animal movement database. Our results highlight the need for a comprehensive analysis of contacts between farms that includes indirect contacts due to truck sharing and contamination. As the nature of animal transport networks is inherently temporal, we strongly suggest the use of temporal network measures in order to evaluate individual and overall risk of disease transmission through animal transportation.",2019,PloS one,14,5,e0217974-e0217974,10.1371/journal.pone.0217974,#626,Sterchi 2019
"Comparing network analysis measures to determine potential epidemic size of highly contagious exotic diseases in fragmented monthly networks of dairy cattle movements in Ontario, Canada.","Dube, C; Ribble, C; Kelton, D; McNab, B","Adult milking cow movements occurring in monthly periods in 2004-2006 were analysed to compare three network analysis measures to determine the lower and upper bounds of potential maximal epidemic size in an unrestrained epidemic: the out-degree, the infection chain or output domain of a farm, and the size of the strong and weak components. The directed networks generated by the movements of adult milking cows were highly fragmented. When all the farms that were not involved in shipments were included in the analysis, the risk of infection transmission through movements of adult cows was very low. To determine the size of an epidemic when an infected farm shipped cows in such a fragmented network, farm out-degree and infection chain provided similar and more reasonable estimates of potential maximal epidemic size than the size of the strong and weak components. Component analysis always provided estimates that were two to three times larger than the out-degree of infection chain approaches. For example, the upper bound was estimated to be 12-13 farms using out-degree and 16-17 farms using the infection chain, the components approach showed a range of 39-51 potentially exposed farms. Strong components provided an inflated measure of the lower bound of potential maximal epidemic size at first diagnosis because the time sequence of shipments was not considered. Weak components provided an inflated measure of the upper bound because both the time sequence and directionality of shipments between farms were ignored. Farm degree and infection chain measures should now be tested to determine their usefulness for estimating maximum epidemic size in large connected networks.",2008,Transboundary and emerging diseases,55,10-Sep,382-92,10.1111/j.1865-1682.2008.01053.x,#662,Dube 2008
Analysis of Swine Movement in Four Canadian Regions: Network Structure and Implications for Disease Spread.,"Thakur, K K; Revie, C W; Hurnik, D; Poljak, Z; Sanchez, J","Direct and indirect contacts among animal holdings are important in the spread of infectious diseases. The objectives of this study were to describe networks of pig movements and the sharing of trucks used for those movements between swine farms in four Canadian regions using network analysis tools and to obtain contact parameters for infectious disease spread simulation models. Four months of swine movement data from a pilot pig traceability programme were used. Two types of networks were created using three time scales (weekly, monthly and the full study period): one-mode networks of farm-to-farm direct contact representing animal shipments and two-mode networks representing the sharing of trucks between farms. Contact patterns among farms were described by estimating a range of relevant network measures. The overall network neglecting the four regions consisted of 145 farms, which were connected by 261 distinct links. A total of 184 trucks were used to transport 2043 shipments of pigs during the study period. The median in- and out-degree for the overall one-mode network was 1 and ranged from 0 to 26 and 0 to 10, respectively. The overall one-mode network had heterogeneous degree distribution, a high clustering coefficient and shorter average path length than would be expected for randomly generated networks of similar size. On average one truck was shared by four farms in the overall network, or by three farms when considered the monthly and weekly networks. Degree distribution of the two-mode overall network demonstrated characteristics of power-law distribution. For more than 50% of shipments on any given day, the same truck was used for at least one other shipment. Findings from this study are in agreement with previous work, which suggested that swine movement networks exhibit small-world and scale-free topologies. Furthermore, trucks used for the shipment of pigs can play an important role in connecting otherwise unconnected farms and may increase the spread of disease.

"Estimating potential epidemic size following introduction of a long-incubation disease in scale-free connected networks of milking-cow movements in Ontario, Canada.","Dube, C; Ribble, C; Kelton, D; McNab, B","We used the movements of adult milking cows among farms enrolled in the Dairy Herd Improvement (DHI) program in Ontario to explore the size of an epidemic that might result from farm-to-farm movements of cows in the Province if a reportable long-incubation infection like tuberculosis (TB) were introduced and not detected for 1-3 years after introduction. A directed network was created for each year (2004-2006) using all pairs of individual shipments, defined as the movement of one or more cows on a single day, from a single source DHI farm to a single recipient DHI farm. A 3-year network was also developed that included all cow shipments that took place during these 3 years. The lower and upper bounds of potential maximal epidemic size were estimated using four network-analysis measures: (1) the farm out-degree, (2) the size of the largest strong and weak components, (3) the bow-tie approach, classifying farms into six different areas of a directed network and (4) the infection chain of a farm. All four of the DHI movement networks were found to be small-world, indicating that infection could spread over considerable distances by shipments that linked potentially distant clusters of farms. The networks were also scale-free, indicating most farms had relatively few connections to other farms, while there were a few highly connected farms. Characterization of the yearly networks showed that 41-47% of DHI farms were not involved in any cow shipments and were therefore not at risk of infection from this movement network; furthermore, if infection were introduced into a DHI farm that shipped animals that year, the infection would have stopped at that farm (or at least, not been passed on by shipment of adult milking cows) >50% of the time, and 75% of the time only one more DHI farm would have become infected through animal movements. Compared to the infection chain, which accounted for both the direction and the time sequence of shipments in the movement network, the other network-analysis measures provided biased estimates of potential epidemic size. The bow-tie approach provided a schematic representation of the level of risk of each farm in the network in spreading an infection, but overestimated the lower- and upper-bound measures of potential epidemic size because it did not account for the time sequence of shipments. Our infection-chain results suggest that introducing a long-incubation disease into the network of farms enrolled in the DHI program in Ontario that was not identified until 12 months after the incursion would, in a worst-case scenario, have resulted in 168 farms (representing 5% of all Ontario DHI herds) being infected as a consequence of adult cow movements among DHI farms. This estimate increased to 850 farms (26% of all DHI herds) if the infection were not identified for 36 months.",2011,Preventive veterinary medicine,99,4-Feb,102-11,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.01.013,#704,Dube 2011
Combining Salmonella Dublin genome information and contact-tracing to substantiate a new approach for improved detection of infectious transmission routes in cattle populations.,"de Knegt, Leonardo Victor; Kudirkiene, Egle; Rattenborg, Erik; Sorensen, Gitte; Denwood, Matthew James; Olsen, John Elmerdahl; Nielsen, Liza Rosenbaum","This study presents a new method for detection of between-herd livestock movements to facilitate disease tracing and more accurately describe network behaviour of relevance for spread of infectious diseases, including within-livestock business risk-carrying contacts that are not necessarily recorded anywhere. The study introduces and substantiates the concept of grouping livestock herds into business-units based on ownership and location in the tracing analysis of animal movement-based contact networks. To test the utility of this approach, whole core genome sequencing of 196 Salmonella Dublin isolates stored from previous surveillance and project activities was combined with information on cattle movements recorded in the Danish Cattle Database between 1997 and 2017. The aim was to investigate alternative explanations for S. Dublin circulation in groups of herds connected by ownership, but without complete records of livestock movements. The EpiContactTrace R-package was used to trace the contact networks between businesses and compare the network characteristics of businesses sharing strains of S. Dublin with different levels of genetic relatedness. The ownership-only definition proved to be an unreliable grouping approach for large businesses, which could have internal distances larger than 250km and therefore do not represent useful epidemiological units. Therefore, the grouping was refined using spatial analysis. More than 90% of final business units formed were composed of one single cattle property, whereas multi-property businesses could reach up to eight properties in a given year, with up to 15 cattle herds having been part of the same business through the study period. Results showed markedly higher probabilities of introduction of infectious animals between proposed businesses from which the same clone of S. Dublin had been isolated, when compared to businesses with non-related strains, thus substantiating the business-unit as an important epidemiological feature to consider in contact network analysis and tracing of infection routes. However, this approach may overestimate real-life contacts between cattle properties and putatively overestimate the degree of risk-contacts within each business, since it is based solely on information about property ownership and location. This does not consider administrative and individual farmers behaviours that essentially keep two properties separated. Despite this, we conclude that defining epidemiological units based on businesses is a promising approach for future disease tracing tasks.",2020,Preventive veterinary medicine,181,,104531-104531,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.09.005,#711,deKnegt 2020
The use of social network analysis to examine the transmission of Salmonella spp. within a vertically integrated broiler enterprise.,"Crabb, Helen Kathleen; Allen, Joanne Lee; Devlin, Joanne Maree; Firestone, Simon Matthew; Stevenson, Mark Anthony; Gilkerson, James Rudkin","To better understand factors influencing infectious agent dispersal within a livestock population information is needed on the nature and frequency of contacts between farm enterprises. This study uses social network analysis to describe the contact network within a vertically integrated broiler poultry enterprise to identify the potential horizontal and vertical transmission pathways for Salmonella spp. Nodes (farms, sheds, production facilities) were identified and the daily movement of commodities (eggs, birds, feed, litter) and people between nodes were extracted from routinely kept farm records. Three time periods were examined in detail, 1- and 8- and 17-weeks of the production cycle and contact networks were described for all movements, and by commodity and production type. All nodes were linked by at least one movement during the study period but network density was low indicating that all potential pathways between nodes did not exist. Salmonella spp. transmission via vertical or horizontal pathways can only occur along directed pathways when those pathways are present. Only two locations (breeder or feed nodes) were identified where the transmission of a single Salmonella spp. clone could theoretically percolate through the network to the broiler or processing nodes. Only the feed transmission pathway directly connected all parts of the network.",2018,Food microbiology,71,,73-81,10.1016/j.fm.2017.03.008,#725,Crabb 2018
Implications of Cattle Trade for the Spread and Control of Infectious Diseases in Slovenia.,"Knific, Tanja; Ocepek, Matjaz; Kirbis, Andrej; Lentz, Hartmut H K","The objectives of this study were to gain insight into the structure of the cattle trade network in Slovenia and to evaluate the potential for infectious disease spread through movements. The study considered cattle movements between different types of premises that occurred between August 1, 2011 and July 31, 2016 with the exclusion of the movements to the end nodes (e.g., slaughterhouses). In the first part, we performed a static network analysis on monthly and yearly snapshots of the network. These time scales reflect our interest in slowly spreading pathogens; namely Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), which causes paratuberculosis, a worldwide economically important disease. The results showed consistency in the network measures over time; nevertheless, it was evident that year to year contacts between premises were changing. The importance of individual premises for the network connectedness was highly heterogeneous and the most influential premises in the network were collection centers, mountain pastures, and pastures. Compared to random node removal, targeted removal informed by ranking based on local network measures from previous years was substantially more effective in network disassociation. Inclusion of the latest movement data improved the results. In the second part, we simulated disease spread using a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) model on the temporal network. The SI model was based on the empirically estimated true prevalence of paratuberculosis in Slovenia and four scenarios for probabilities of transmission. Different probabilities were realized by the generation of new networks with the corresponding proportion of contacts which were randomly selected from the original network. These diluted networks served as substrates for simulation of MAP spread. The probability of transmission had a significant influence on the velocity of disease spread through the network.

Network analysis of Danish cattle industry trade patterns as an evaluation of risk potential for disease spread.,"Bigras-Poulin, M; Thompson, R A; Chriel, M; Mortensen, S; Greiner, M","Trade patterns of animal movements in a specific industry are complex and difficult to study because there are many stakeholders, premises that are heterogeneously spread over the country, and a highly dynamic flow of animals exists among them. The Danish cattle industry was defined as a network of animal movements and graph theory was used to analyse the movements of cattle within this network. A premise was defined as a farm, an abattoir or a market. These premises constituted the network nodes in the graph and the animal movements between them were the links. In this framework, each premise had a sub-network of other premises to which it was linked by these animal movements. If no movement of animals were registered for a specific farm, then the sub-network for that premise consisted of only that premise. Otherwise, the sub-network linked the premise of interest to all premises from which and to which animals were moved, as long as there was a path linking animal movements to that specific premise. This approach allowed visualization and analyses of four levels of organization that existed in Denmark animal registers: (1) the animal that was moved, (2) the movements of all animals between two premises, (3) the specific premise network, and (4) the overall industry network. When contagious animals are moved from one premise to another, then to a third and so forth, these movements create a path for potential transfer of pathogens. The paths within which pathogens are present identify the transmission risks. A network of animal movements should provide information about pathogen transmission and disease spread. The network of the Danish cattle industry network was a directed scale-free graph (the direction of a movement was known), with an in-degree power of 2 an out-degree power of 1.46, consisted of 29,999 nodes, and 130,265 movements during a 6-month period. The in clustering coefficient was calculated to be 0.52 for the inward direction (movement to), while it was 0.02 for the outward direction (movement from). In Denmark, the cattle movements between premises demonstrated a large degree of heterogeneity. This heterogeneity in movements between farms should be used to evaluate the risk potential of disease transmission for each premise and must be considered when modelling disease spread between premises. The objective of this research was to describe the network of animal movements and not just the animal movements per se.",2006,Preventive veterinary medicine,76,2-Jan,Nov-39,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2006.04.004,#743,Bigras-Poulin 2006
Estimation of distance related probability of animal movements between holdings and implications for disease spread modeling.,"Lindstrom, Tom; Sisson, Scott A; Noremark, Maria; Jonsson, Annie; Wennergren, Uno","Between holding contacts are more common over short distances and this may have implications for the dynamics of disease spread through these contacts. A reliable estimation of how contacts depend on distance is therefore important when modeling livestock diseases. In this study, we have developed a method for analyzing distant dependent contacts and applied it to animal movement data from Sweden. The data were analyzed with two competing models. The first model assumes that contacts arise from a purely distance dependent process. The second is a mixture model and assumes that, in addition, some contacts arise independent of distance. Parameters were estimated with a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach and the model probabilities were compared. We also investigated possible between model differences in predicted contact structures, using a collection of network measures. We found that the mixture model was a much better model for the data analyzed. Also, the network measures showed that the models differed considerably in predictions of contact structures, which is expected to be important for disease spread dynamics. We conclude that a model with contacts being both dependent on, and independent of, distance was preferred for modeling the example animal movement contact data.",2009,Preventive veterinary medicine,91,4-Feb,85-94,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.05.022,#772,Lindstrom 2009
Construction of networks with intrinsic temporal structure from UK cattle movement data.,"Heath, M Fred; Vernon, Matthew C; Webb, Cerian R","BACKGROUND: The implementation of national systems for recording the movements of cattle between agricultural holdings in the UK has enabled the development and parameterisation of network-based models for disease spread. These data can be used to form a network in which each cattle-holding location is represented by a single node and links between nodes are formed if there is a movement of cattle between them in the time period selected. However, this approach loses information on the time sequence of events thus reducing the accuracy of model predictions. In this paper, we propose an alternative way of structuring the data which retains information on the sequence of events but which still enables analysis of the structure of the network. The fundamental feature of this network is that nodes are not individual cattle-holding locations but are instead direct movements between pairs of locations. Links are made between nodes when the second node is a subsequent movement from the location that received the first movement.RESULTS: Two networks are constructed assuming (i) a 7-day and (ii) a 14-day infectious period using British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) data from 2004 and 2005. During this time period there were 4,183,670 movements that could be derived from the database. In both networks over 98% of the connected nodes formed a single giant weak component. Degree distributions show scale-free behaviour over a limited range only, due to the heterogeneity of locations: farms, markets, shows, abattoirs. Simulation of the spread of disease across the networks demonstrates that this approach to restructuring the data enables efficient comparison of the impact of transmission rates on disease spread.CONCLUSION: The redefinition of what constitutes a node has provided a means to simulate disease spread using all the information available in the BCMS database whilst providing a network that can be described analytically. This will enable the construction of generic networks with similar properties with which to assess the impact of small changes in network structure on disease dynamics.",2008,BMC veterinary research,4,,11-Nov,10.1186/1746-6148-4-11,#818,Heath 2008
"Social Network Analysis of Cattle Movement in Sukhothai Province, Thailand: A Study to Improve Control Measurements.","Noopataya, Supot; Thongratsakul, Sukanya; Poolkhet, Chaithep","The aim of this study is to analyse the pattern of cattle movement in Sukhothai province, Thailand. A validated questionnaire was applied to 308 respondents related to cattle farming using one-step snowball sampling. The results showed that most of the nodes are farmers who move their animals in the province. The average normalized degree centrality and normalized closeness centrality were low (<0.01 and 0.04, resp.). We found that traders are the nodes with a high value of centrality. This corresponds with the cutpoint analysis results that traders are outstanding. In conclusion, the relevant authorities should focus on the nodes such as traders for controlling disease. However, a measure to detect disease in the early stages needs to be implemented. ",2015,Veterinary medicine international,2015,,587252-587252,10.1155/2015/587252,#916,Noopataya 2015
Disease transmission on fragmented contact networks: Livestock-associated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the Danish pig-industry,"Ciccolini, M.; Dahl, J.; Chase-Topping, M.E.; Woolhouse, M.E.J.","Animal trade in industrialised livestock-production systems creates a complex, heterogeneous, contact network that shapes between-herd transmission of infectious diseases. We report the results of a simple mathematical model that explores patterns of spread and persistence of livestock-associated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) in the Danish pig-industry associated with this trade network. Simulations show that LA-MRSA can become endemic sustained by animal movements alone. Despite the extremely low predicted endemic prevalence, eradication may be difficult, and decreasing within-farm prevalence, or the time it takes a LA-MRSA positive farm to recover a negative status, fails to break long-term persistence. Our results suggest that a low level of non-movement induced transmission strongly affects MRSA dynamics, increasing endemic prevalence and probability of persistence. We also compare the model-predicted risk of 291 individual farms becoming MRSA positive, with results from a recent Europe-wide survey of LA-MRSA in holdings with breeding pigs, and find a significant correlation between contact-network connectivity properties and the model-estimated risk measure.",2012,Epidemics,4,4 p.171-178,171-178,10.1016/j.epidem.2012.09.001,#1041,Ciccolini 2012

The model estimated the vaccination coverage, the protective seroconversion level, and the duration of immunity for each node of the network and vaccination scenario. Partial budget analysis was used to compare the benefit-cost of the different vaccination scenarios. The model predicted that targeting day-old chick avian influenza (AI) vaccination in industrial and large hatcheries would increase immunity levels in the overall poultry population in Egypt and especially in small commercial poultry farms (from <30% to >60%).

Spatio-temporal modelling of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli O157 in cattle in Sweden: exploring options for control,"Widgren, Stefan; Engblom, Stefan; Emanuelson, Ulf; Lindberg, Ann","A spatial data-driven stochastic model was developed to explore the spread of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli O157 (VTEC O157) by livestock movements and local transmission among neighbouring holdings in the complete Swedish cattle population. Livestock data were incorporated to model the time-varying contact network between holdings and population demographics. Furthermore, meteorological data with the average temperature at the geographical location of each holding was used to incorporate season. The model was fitted against observed data and extensive numerical experiments were conducted to investigate the model’s response to control strategies aimed at reducing shedding and susceptibility, as well as interventions informed by network measures. The results showed that including local spread and season improved agreement with prevalence studies. Also, control strategies aimed at reducing the average shedding rate were more efficient in reducing the VTEC O157 prevalence than strategies based on network measures. The methodology presented in this study could provide a basis for developing disease surveillance on regional and national scales, where observed data are combined with readily available high-resolution data in simulations to get an overview of potential disease spread in unobserved regions.",2018,Veterinary research,49,1 p.78-78,78-78,10.1186/s13567-018-0574-2,#1109,Widgren 2018
Modelling African swine fever virus spread in pigs using time‐respective network data: Scientific support for decision makers,"Andraud, Mathieu; Hammami, Pachka; H. Hayes, Brandon; A. Galvis, Jason; Vergne, Timothée; Machado, Gustavo; Rose, Nicolas","African swine fever (ASF) represents the main threat to swine production, with heavy economic consequences for both farmers and the food industry. The spread of the virus that causes ASF through Europe raises the issues of identifying transmission routes and assessing their relative contributions in order to provide insights to stakeholders for adapted surveillance and control measures. A simulation model was developed to assess ASF spread over the commercial swine network in France. The model was designed from raw movement data and actual farm characteristics. A metapopulation approach was used, with transmission processes at the herd level potentially leading to external spread to epidemiologically connected herds. Three transmission routes were considered: local transmission (e.g. fomites, material exchange), movement of animals from infected to susceptible sites, and transit of trucks without physical animal exchange. Surveillance was represented by prevalence and mortality detection thresholds at herd level, which triggered control measures through movement ban for detected herds and epidemiologically related herds. The time from infection to detection varied between 8 and 21 days, depending on the detection criteria, but was also dependent on the types of herds in which the infection was introduced. Movement restrictions effectively reduced the transmission between herds, but local transmission was nevertheless observed in higher proportions highlighting the need of global awareness of all actors of the swine industry to mitigate the risk of local spread. Raw movement data were directly used to build a dynamic network on a realistic timescale. This approach allows for a rapid update of input data without any pre‐treatment, which could be important in terms of responsiveness, should an introduction occur.",2022,Transboundary and emerging diseases,69,5 p.e2132-e2144,e2132-e2144,10.1111/tbed.14550,#1169,Andraud 2022
A discrete‐time survival model for porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus,"Trostle, Parker; Corzo, Cesar A.; Reich, Brian J.; Machado, Gustavo","Since the arrival of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the United States in 2013, elimination and control programmes have had partial success. The dynamics of its spread are hard to quantify, though previous work has shown that local transmission and the transfer of pigs within production systems are most associated with the spread of PEDV. Our work relies on the history of PEDV infections in a region of the southeastern United States. This infection data is complemented by farm‐level features and extensive industry data on the movement of both pigs and vehicles. We implement a discrete‐time survival model and evaluate different approaches to modelling the local‐transmission and network effects. We find strong evidence in that the local‐transmission and pig‐movement effects are associated with the spread of PEDV, even while controlling for seasonality, farm‐level features and the possible spread of disease by vehicles. Our fully Bayesian model permits full uncertainty quantification of these effects. Our farm‐level out‐of‐sample predictions have a receiver‐operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.779 and a precision‐recall AUC of 0.097. The quantification of these effects in a comprehensive model allows stakeholders to make more informed decisions about disease prevention efforts.",2022,Transboundary and Emerging Diseases,69,6 p.3693-3703,3693-3703,10.1111/tbed.14739,#1175,Trostle 2022

Complex network analysis to understand trading partnership in French swine production.,"Hammami, P.; Widgren, S.; Grosbois, V.; Apolloni, A.; Rose, N.; Andraud, M.","The circulation of livestock pathogens in the pig industry is strongly related to animal movements. Epidemiological models developed to understand the circulation of pathogens within the industry should include the probability of transmission via between-farm contacts. The pig industry presents a structured network in time and space, whose composition changes over time. Therefore, to improve the predictive capabilities of epidemiological models, it is important to identify the drivers of farmers' choices in terms of trade partnerships. Combining complex network analysis approaches and exponential random graph models, this study aims to analyze patterns of the swine industry network and identify key factors responsible for between-farm contacts at the French scale. The analysis confirms the topological stability of the network over time while highlighting the important roles of companies, types of farm, farm sizes, outdoor housing systems and batch-rearing systems. Both approaches revealed to be complementary and very effective to understand the drivers of the network.

Static network analysis of a pork supply chain in Northern Germany - characterisation of the potential spread of infectious diseases via animal movements.,"Buttner, K.; Krieter, J.; Traulsen, A.; Traulsen, I.","Transport of live animals is a major risk factor in the spread of infectious diseases between holdings. The present study analysed the pork supply chain of a producer community in Northern Germany. The structure of trade networks can be characterised by carrying out a network analysis. To identify holdings with a central position in this directed network of pig production, several parameters describing these properties were measured (in-degree, out-degree, ingoing and outgoing infection chain, betweenness centrality and ingoing and outgoing closeness centrality). To obtain the importance of the different holding types (multiplier, farrowing farms, finishing farms and farrow-to-finishing farms) within the pyramidal structure of the pork supply chain, centrality parameters were calculated for the entire network as well as for the individual holding types. Using these centrality parameters, two types of holdings could be identified. In the network studied, finishing and farrow-to-finishing farms were more likely to be infected due to the high number of ingoing trade contacts. Due to the high number of outgoing trade contacts multipliers and farrowing farms had an increased risk to spread a disease to other holdings. However, the results of the centrality parameters degree and infection chain were not always consistent, such that the indirect trade contacts should be taken into consideration to understand the real importance of a holding in spreading or contracting an infection. Furthermore, all calculated parameters showed a highly right-skewed distribution. Networks with such a degree distribution are considered to be highly resistant concerning the random removal of nodes. But by strategic removal of the most central holdings, e.g. by trade restrictions or selective vaccination or culling, the network structure can be changed efficiently and thus decompose into fragments. Such a fragmentation of the trade networks is of particular importance from an epidemiological perspective.",2013,Preventive Veterinary Medicine,110,4-Mar,418-428,10.1016/j.prevetmed.2013.01.008,#1374,Buttner 2013
Livestock movement patterns in the main livestock production provinces of Lao PDR.,"Subharat, S.; Wada, M.; Sutar, A.; Abila, R.; Khounsy, S.; Heuer, C.","Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly infectious transboundary disease that is endemic and affects the livelihood of smallholder farmers in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). Knowledge about livestock movement patterns is important for preventing the spread of FMD between villages. This study describes the livestock movement patterns in Champasak, Savannakhet and Xiangkhouang provinces of Lao PDR. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with randomly selected villagers (n = 195) and traders (n = 169) in 115 villages between February and March 2019. Livestock owners commonly purchased (mainly breeding) animals from other smallholders (81%) and sold (mainly slaughter) animals to traders (76%) or other smallholders (16%), typically within the same district and province. The median inter-village trade distance was 20-30 km, with an average frequency of 4 trades per village per month. Traders purchased animals from smallholders (71%) and middlemen (25%) located within their district. It was common for many traders (74%) to retain animals at their property before selling, typically a median of 4 beef cattle per trader. Local trades within the district were far more common (72%) than distant trades. The movements of grazing/fattening large ruminants between villages were reported in 30% of the villages in all three provinces and occurred mostly within the same district or province in short distance (6 km). Social Network Analysis has identified animal movement hubs in the three provinces which could be targeted for FMD control and surveillance. Movements of animals for further use (fattening/ reproduction), long-distance movements and frequent local movements described in this area have important implications for FMD circulation. The findings from the study will inform FMD spread simulation models for Lao PDR. The knowledge gained from these data will also help the Lao PDR authorities understand the patterns of animal movements associated with disease spread.",2021,Transboundary and Emerging Diseases,69,4,e322-e335,10.1111/tbed.14303,#1382,Subharat 2021
Livestock network analysis for rhodesiense human African trypanosomiasis control in Uganda.,"Okello, W. O.; Amongi, C. A.; Muhanguzi, D.; MacLeod, E. T.; Waiswa, C.; Shaw, A. P.; Welburn, S. C.","Background: Infected cattle sourced from districts with established foci for Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense human African trypanosomiasis (rHAT) migrating to previously unaffected districts, have resulted in a significant expansion of the disease in Uganda. This study explores livestock movement data to describe cattle trade network topology and assess the effects of disease control interventions on the transmission of rHAT infectiousness. Methods: Network analysis was used to generate a cattle trade network with livestock data which was collected from cattle traders (n = 197) and validated using random graph methods. Additionally, the cattle trade network was combined with a susceptible, infected, recovered (SIR) compartmental model to simulate spread of rHAT (Ro 1.287), hence regarded as ""slow"" pathogen, and evaluate the effects of disease interventions. Results: The cattle trade network exhibited a low clustering coefficient (0.5) with most cattle markets being weakly connected and a few being highly connected. Also, analysis of the cattle movement data revealed a core group comprising of cattle markets from both eastern (rHAT endemic) and northwest regions (rHAT unaffected area). Presence of a core group may result in rHAT spread to unaffected districts and occurrence of super spreader cattle market or markets in case of an outbreak. The key cattle markets that may be targeted for routine rHAT surveillance and control included Namutumba, Soroti, and Molo, all of which were in southeast Uganda. Using effective trypanosomiasis such as integrated cattle injection with trypanocides and spraying can sufficiently slow the spread of rHAT in the network. Conclusion: Cattle trade network analysis indicated a pathway along which T. b. rhodesiense could spread northward from eastern Uganda. Targeted T. b. rhodesiense surveillance and control in eastern Uganda, through enhanced public-private partnerships, would serve to limit its spread.",2021,Frontiers in Veterinary Science,7,June,,10.3389/fvets.2021.611132,#1397,Okello 2021

Two trading practices were distinguished: usual trade and a traditional barter practice named kapsile. Social network analysis methods and logistic regression were used to analyse data.

Dynamic network connectivity influences the spread of a sub-lineage of Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.,"Makau, D. N.; Paploski, I. A. D.; Corzo, C. A.; Vanderwaal, K.","Swine production in the United States is characterized by dynamic farm contacts through animal movements; such movements shape the risk of disease occurrence on farms. Pig movements have been linked to the spread of a virulent porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), RFLP type 1-7-4, herein denoted as phylogenetic sub-lineage 1A [L1A]. This study aimed to quantify the contribution of pig movements to the risk of L1A occurrence on farms in the United States. Farms were defined as L1A-positive in a given 6-month period if at least one L1A sequence was recovered from the farm. Temporal network autocorrelation modelling was performed using data on animal movements and 1,761 PRRSV ORF5 sequences linked to 494 farms from a dense pig production area in the United States between 2014 and 2017. A farm's current and past exposure to L1A and other PRRSV variants was assessed through its primary and secondary contacts in the animal movement network. Primary and secondary contacts with an L1A-positive farm increased the likelihood of L1A occurrence on a farm by 19% (p = .04) and 23% (p = .03), respectively. While the risk posed by primary contacts with PRRS-positive farms is unsurprising, the observation that secondary contacts also increase the likelihood of infection is novel. Risk of L1A occurrence on a farm also increased by 3.0% (p = .01) for every additional outgoing shipment, possibly due to biosecurity breaches during loading and transporting pigs from the farm. Finally, use of vaccines or field virus inoculation on sow farms one year prior reduced the risk of L1A occurrence in downstream farms by 36% (p = .04), suggesting that control measures that reduce viral circulation and enhance immunological protection in sow farms have a carry-over effect on L1A occurrence in downstream farms. Therefore, coordinated disease management interventions between farms connected via animal movements may be more effective than individual farm-based interventions.",2021,Transboundary and Emerging Diseases,69,2,524-537,10.1111/tbed.14016,#1452,Makau 2021
Merging DNA typing and network analysis to assess the transmission of paratuberculosis between farms.,"Marquetoux, N.; Heuer, C.; Wilson, P.; Ridler, A.; Stevenson, M.","Paratuberculosis, a chronic enteric infection caused by Mycobacterium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), is endemic in all farmed ruminant species in New Zealand. The use of genotyping in combination with network analysis of livestock movement events from one farm location to another has the potential to contribute to our understanding of between-farm transmission events. We studied a population of 122 farms from a corporate commercial livestock enterprise in New Zealand, trading with each other in near isolation from other commercial farms. The data consisted of longitudinal movements to and from these farms between 2006 and 2010, as well as the results of cross-sectional MAP screening and genotyping performed in 2010. We explored associations between past livestock movements and current strain type distribution in this population of farms using quadratic assignment procedure. Our results show that measures of farm clustering within the movement network were significantly associated with sharing of MAP strains. For example, farms closely related by trade were twice as likely to share the same strains of MAP (p=0.033). Other covariates were also associated with the probability of sharing the same strains of MAP, such as being located on the same island (OR=5.8 to 8.7, p<0.01), farming the same livestock species and Euclidian distance between farms.

Modelagem de medidas de controle em redes de movimentacao de animais.,"Ossada, R.","The animals' movements in a farms network and the spread of some animal diseases are intrinsically related. Therefore, comprehending the dynamics of the spreading of infectious diseases in these networks is an important tool in controlling these diseases. Using the information about the bovine movements from the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil, in 2007, we rebuilt the network of animal movements and the geographic proximity network between the premises of this state, in addition to hypothetical networks following the network models Molloy-Reed, Kalisky, Method A and Method B, where we simulated, using different configurations of the model SLIRS, the spread of diseases with hypothetical parameters e real ones (brucellosis and foot and mouth disease). Moreover, we simulated the control of these diseases spreading, considering the control by immunization and by restriction, with and without the rearrangement of the movements after the restriction, selecting the premises to be protected randomly, based on the degree of animal's movements and using the concept of the friendship paradox. Among the results, stands out that although the pattern of the prevalence curves in the hypothetical networks were similar to the ones in the real network, the observed values were higher in the hypothetical networks, indicating that using them in the planning of policies to control diseases in place of the real network might lead to a greater expense of resources than it would be necessary. Furthermore, in the control of the diseases both with hypothetical parameters as well as with real parameters, in the simulations using only the animal's movements network, it was observed a more effective reduction of the prevalence when selecting the premises with the highest total degree than the random selection, while in the simulations that considered the network of geographic proximity of the premises, the reduction in the prevalence of the strategies that selected specific premises were similar to the random selection. On the effect of rearranging the movements, it was observed that it may facilitate the spread of diseases in the network even in situations where some control strategy is used. We hope that the results of the mathematical simulations may contribute to the discussion of the relative impact of the mentioned control strategies and that in the future they may assist in the activities of agencies responsible for disease surveillance and in the development of policies to prevent and control diseases in animals.",2015,Modelagem de medidas de controle em redes de movimentacao de animais,,,103-pp.,,#1574,Ossada 2015

The highest weighted-in- and weighted-outdegree centralities were observed in Bangkok and Kanchanaburi Province at 264 and 68, respectively. Moreover, the highest import risk of caprine brucellosis into Nonthaburi Province was found in Nakhon Pathom at 13.401.93 whereas the highest export risk was noticed in Bangkok at 17.451.05. Conclusions: The identified provinces should be closely monitored especially in terms of animal movements. This study may help relevant authorities prioritize the high-risk areas and optimize control measures. Our methods could also be applied to other diseases or animal species in different geographical locations.",2017,Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Disease,7,8,477-481,10.12980/apjtd.7.2017D7-85,#1595,Chintrakulchai 2017

A national-scale picture of U.S. cattle movements obtained from Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection data,"Buhnerkempe, Michael G.; Grear, Daniel A.; Portacci, Katie; Miller, Ryan S.; Lombard, Jason E.; Webb, Colleen T.","We present the first comprehensive description of how shipments of cattle connect the geographic extent and production diversity of the United States cattle industry. We built a network of cattle movement from a state-stratified 10% systematic sample of calendar year 2009 Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) data. ICVIs are required to certify the apparent health of cattle moving across state borders and allow us to examine cattle movements at the county scale. The majority of the ICVI sample consisted of small shipments (<20 head) moved for feeding and beef production. Geographically, the central plains states had the most connections, correlated to feeding infrastructure. The entire nation was closely connected when interstate movements were summarized at the state level. At the county-level, the U.S. is still well connected geographically, but significant heterogeneities in the location and identity of counties central to the network emerge. Overall, the network of interstate movements is described by a hub structure, with a few counties sending or receiving extremely large numbers of shipments and many counties sending and receiving few shipments. The county-level network also has a very low proportion of reciprocal movements, indicating that high-order network properties may be better at describing a county's importance than simple summaries of the number of shipments or animals sent and received. We suggest that summarizing cattle movements at the state level homogenizes the network and a county level approach is most appropriate for examining processes influenced by cattle shipments, such as economic analyses and disease outbreaks.",2013,Preventive Veterinary Medicine,112,3,318-329,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2013.08.002,#2666,Buhnerkempe 2013
Application of network analysis parameters in risk-based surveillance – Examples based on cattle trade data and bovine infections in Sweden,"Frössling, Jenny; Ohlson, Anna; Björkman, Camilla; Håkansson, Nina; Nöremark, Maria","Financial resources may limit the number of samples that can be collected and analysed in disease surveillance programmes. When the aim of surveillance is disease detection and identification of case herds, a risk-based approach can increase the sensitivity of the surveillance system. In this paper, the association between two network analysis measures, i.e. ‘in-degree’ and ‘ingoing infection chain’, and signs of infection is investigated. It is shown that based on regression analysis of combined data from a recent cross-sectional study for endemic viral infections and network analysis of animal movements, a positive serological result for bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is significantly associated with the purchase of animals. For BCV, this association was significant also when accounting for herd size and regional cattle density, but not for BRSV. Examples are given for different approaches to include cattle movement data in risk-based surveillance by selecting herds based on network analysis measures. Results show that compared to completely random sampling these approaches increase the number of detected positives, both for BCV and BRSV in our study population. It is concluded that network measures for the relevant time period based on updated databases of animal movements can provide a simple and straight forward tool for risk-based sampling.",2012,Preventive Veterinary Medicine,105,3,202-208,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.12.011,#2667,Frössling 2012
The Impact of Movements and Animal Density on Continental Scale Cattle Disease Outbreaks in the United States,"Buhnerkempe, Michael G.; Tildesley, Michael J.; Lindström, Tom; Grear, Daniel A.; Portacci, Katie; Miller, Ryan S.; Lombard, Jason E.; Werkman, Marleen; Keeling, Matt J.; Wennergren, Uno; Webb, Colleen T.","Globalization has increased the potential for the introduction and spread of novel pathogens over large spatial scales necessitating continental-scale disease models to guide emergency preparedness. Livestock disease spread models, such as those for the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in the United Kingdom, represent some of the best case studies of large-scale disease spread. However, generalization of these models to explore disease outcomes in other systems, such as the United States’s cattle industry, has been hampered by differences in system size and complexity and the absence of suitable livestock movement data. Here, a unique database of US cattle shipments allows estimation of synthetic movement networks that inform a near-continental scale disease model of a potential FMD-like (i.e., rapidly spreading) epidemic in US cattle. The largest epidemics may affect over one-third of the US and 120,000 cattle premises, but cattle movement restrictions from infected counties, as opposed to national movement moratoriums, are found to effectively contain outbreaks. Slow detection or weak compliance may necessitate more severe state-level bans for similar control. Such results highlight the role of large-scale disease models in emergency preparedness, particularly for systems lacking comprehensive movement and outbreak data, and the need to rapidly implement multi-scale contingency plans during a potential US outbreak.",2014,PLOS ONE,9,3,e91724-,,#2668,Buhnerkempe 2014
