This dominance of markets in centrality measures suggests that they can have a significant role as pathogen spreaders and be targeted for control and surveillance measures; In this sense, Marquetoux et al. (2016) indicate that network fragmentation can be achieved by removing central nodes that serve as bridges between them because they connect otherwise non-connected nodes or clusters, decreasing the probability of large epidemics. In addition, Natale et al. (2009) suggest that centrality measures can characterize holdings assessing the potential to cause epidemics, showing that when nodes with high eigenvector centrality values the seed for an infection a strong correlation with the extent of the epidemics appears; Live animals auction markets have a significant effect on masking underlying networks characteristics and variation in some metrics that are important for assessing the risk for pathogen spread; Study has shown that markets can be important source of infection to herds (increased odds of having high ingoing contact chain values). Moreover, markets seem to be the primary commercialization channel for small holding farmers. Markets can serve as bridges shortening pathways and increasing connectivity in the networks.","it is complex to assess the impact of this relationship because most of the connections do not correspond to direct connections from herds outside regions to holdings within the Los Rios Region; it is critical to remember that while evaluating these measures, the speed with which a pathogen might spread within a farm must be taken into account; we used a static network to represent a dynamic system in that all movements within a specified period are merged and the temporal order is lost; it was challenging to identify nodes that act as cattle dealers and differentiate between fattening and breeding herds because all of those nodes are registered as generic beef herds in the official database; weighting links and a lack of knowledge about the animals' residency period can be useful in determining the strength of relationships that may be significant for pathogen spread; Large static networks can mask connectivity features that arise in disaggregated networks; Control measures such as market movement restrictions or standsill periods might result in rewiring phenomenon, affecting connectivity and metric values; challenging to identify nodes that act as cattle dealers and differentiate between fattening and breeding herds because all of those nodes are registered as generic beef herds in the official database; static networks may over-represent the network's connectivity."," small herds movement features need to be further explored to assess in more detail for example if special considerations regarding control strategies need to be evaluated for this herd class, such as facilitating direct commercialization with slaughterhouses or promoting the increase of a specific disease-free status that ensures safe trade; These correlations show that other less dominant nodes can play a similar role even though highly dominant nodes were removed, pointing out that the network’s underlying features must be explored; surveillance or at least biosecurity measures prior to the introduction of animals purchased in markets is recommended due to the infectious potential given by the direct and indirect contacts of markets with herds with unknown or potential infected status; This information will enhance our understanding of the epidemiology of many endemic infectious diseases, and it will be helpful to implement a future Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) pilot control program in the area for example. Exploring the connections between Provinces within the Los Rios Region can provide insights for compartmentalization or zoning strategies; important to consider the speed with which a pathogen might spread within a farm when considering measure implementation (short infectious duration versus more lenghty infectious period); Surveillance or biosecurity measures prior to introduction of animals purchased in markets is recommended due to infectious potential given by the direct and indirect contacts of markets with herds with unknown or potencial infected status.",

","Although live pig movements were identified as the main transmission route, the results evidenced the need of compliance with external biosecurity, to limit the transmission in the neighborhood of infected farms as well as disinfection of vehicles; Although playing a minor role in the transmission process, truck transit should not be neglected and complex rounds serving several production sites have to be considered in the tracking surveillance system; ERGMs offer a promising approach, allowing for characterizing the main factors governing the network structure, from which simulated networks can be generated - this way, these models would get free from historical/past data, improving outcome predictiveness.",

In the present study, four arcs [i.e. all movements associated to link up to and including 4 arcs] moving from and leading to the specific farm, which occurred during the observation period, were used to construct the farm network for each specific farm. The whole industry network was constituted by the set of all premises and the set of all arcs. Data analyses for the whole industry network were also repeated for one general subnet. This subnet was constituted by excluding abattoirs and slaughter related movements from the swine movement data.

It can then be inferred that a disease present in the Danish swine industry that can transmit through animal movements was likely to remain present because it can easily hide in the large component; The network approach proposed in this project has shown to be much more appropriate to support disease control activities because it can better handle heterogeneity. The network analysis used, especially if the knowledge is made available through a geographic information system, can provide a means to achieve the trace history and potential risk level of the premises involved as index case or cases","Trade patterns of animal movements for a specific industry are complex and difficult to study because there are many swine production related premises of different types that are heterogeneously spread over the country, and a highly dynamic flow of animals move among these premises; truck routes were not available since the order of the pick ups and beginning and end of truck routes were not present in the data files; Within the Danish swine industry the individual animal moved was not registered, only movements of a lot of swine were recorded so the types of pig moved were unknown; Data validation was often a problem because the analysis and description of trade patterns required the construction of many data files from data originating from various data sources, leading to some missing values; There could be some biases: potential representation bias associated with exclusion caused by missing data, bias related to the observation period which is only 6 months long, and bias due to the lack of precision in animal categories used (missing age categories, farm specialization categories, and production site category).","Adding the animal age information would permit a much better understanding of movements occurring between similar types of premises and analysis of dynamics could be improved if a time-space continuum was used; Disease control must be achieved at the premise scale, not at the whole industry scale as is the case for preparedness; To be useful, the movements of the index case or cases need to be updated rapidly. For prolonged usage throughout management of the crisis, data on movements of animals must be updated in real time.

If a measure of connectivity was required to assess the network prior to disease management, the number of components, GSCC, and GWCC size would be useful metrics to assess connectivity and vulnerability. This is due to the use of component numbers as a measure of network fragmentation in this study. For the GSCC and GWCC, their use would be beneficial given their interpretation as approximate lower and upper bounds for an estimated epidemic size if such a disease was to be introduced","these networks were only built upon movements between premises and do not include movements within the premises. These within-herd movements can be frequent, and are important as many enterprises in NI exhibit farm fragmentation (conacre) as they are made up of two or more geographically distinct land parcels; diseases like bTB that also have a wildlife reservoir, i.e. the badger Meles meles (Allen, et al., 2018), spillover could also occur from herds to wildlife, which could impact on infection introduction in the local landscape; extensiveness of the study was also a limitation due to the increased likelihood of Type 1 (significance level was at 2.89*10*5) and Type 2 errors occurring when comparing the manipulated networks with the corresponding observed data.","Given that many endemic diseases, like bTB, are already difficult to control, it may be appropriate to use updated, near ‘real-time’, movement data to further assist disease management, especially when such data are readily available; Markets were also, unsurprisingly, the most influential nodes in the networks of this study (also see Robinson and Christley, 2007) and future disease management should consider their potential importance in targeting interventions and spreading infection. The influence of markets can be particularly noticed in their high degree values and the increasing reciprocity as more cattle are moved between them towards the end of the production cycle – though like findings elsewhere, not all markets were equally as central or connected; The potential importance of markets in terms of infection control should be considered for future research, especially when a highly connected network such as the one observed in NI exists; Future analyses could target time periods of interest to maximise their utility and to be able to compare varying targeted interventions more effectively.",

These chains were divided into two main types: the in-going contact chains (ICC) and the out-going contact chains (OCC). We incorporated within farm and between  farm dynamics through a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) model using the temporal animal movement data explicitly with a higher effective contact rate to ensure an efficient disease transmission over the simulations. We implemented a discrete dynamic stochastic model that accounts for: (i) the local dynamics that represent each animal population (bovine, swine, and small ruminants); and (ii) the global dynamics that represent the interaction within farms and slaughterhouses; using a time resolution of 1 day. The initial simulation procedure was seeded in 1000 farms for  each simulation. This was repeated so that each single-host farm or multi-host farm was the initial seeded farm for a total of 100 simulations. For the between-farm dynamics, susceptible farms, Si, can be infected by their contacts via daily animal movements. Within these dynamics, animal movements to a slaughterhouse destination were considered to be subtracting these animals from the system. Each draw of animals from S and I compartments were at random, while the total number of available animals were based on the official data provided by for each premises. We additionally considered the effect of sequential removal of farms from the network, based on their ranked order. Furthermore, a sample of nodes was generated to be removed to simulate the non-targeted implementation of control actions from 2017 to 2018. The targeted farms were removed before model simulation was started to fragment the contact network, and the number of infected farms was then calculated at the end of each full simulation,.Since one of our objectives was to quantify the potential of a given infected host infecting another susceptible host(s) via animal transport, we developed scenarios A to C where the infection was seeded at bovine, small ruminants, and swine single host farms, respectively. Transportation of infected animals across multi-host farms was the only mode of disease propagation into other host species sites. In scenario D, infections were seeded in multi-host farms with at least two species (e.g. bovine and swine), and in scenario E, farms were randomly selected from the full network and seeded. Each simulation started with 1000 infected farms drawn randomly from the farm list as the initially-seeded infections according to the model scenario and repeated 1000 times.

The network was inferred by statistical modelling of the observed movements. First, to distinguish true from the artefactual absence of movements (months where an origin ward sent out no cattle), a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) generalized linear model (GLM) was fitted to each origin ward, so that in subsequent modelling steps, movements would be imputed in place of false zeroes. Next, inter-ward livestock movement was modelled using a hurdle model. The combined models can therefore be viewed as a gravity model of the livestock movement network. The fitted model was used to simulate monthly movements among the 398 wards for 1 year, with the number of movements inflated twofold to account for using a 50% subsample of the data. The simulated data were used to create an observed yearaggregated, static, directed, weighted cattle movement network. The spread of a ‘fast’ (R0 ¼ 3) and ‘slow’ (R0 ¼ 1.5) pathogen was simulated on the multiplex to assess the effects of disease control interventions on the spread of pathogens with varying infectiousness.

Minimum, median, mean, 95th percentile, and maximum values are reported for each timescale over the 10-year study period. For metrics that describe the full network, only the maximum value is reported for the decennial network. We also provide information on the number of potential mass dispersal events that occur in each year. We define a mass dispersal event to occur when more than 30% of a herd (with a minimum of ten total cows) is moved to another herd(s).","minimum, median, mean, 95th percentile, and maximum values for each timescale; clustering coefficient; density; reciprocity; strong components; weak components; LWC; LSC; out-degree; in-degree; contact chain; betweenness; assortativity; shortest path",N,-,"Between-herd movements of cows in Ontario were primarily local events with few long-distance movements; Ontario dairy herds are not spread equally across the province, with most clustering in southwest and eastern Ontario; 53% of movements over 400km occurred between the eastern and southern/western regions; We observed that as timescale increased, subgroups within the network became larger and the overall cohesion of the network increased; As subgroups become more highly connected, larger contact chain values are reported more frequently; The median outgoing contact chain, ranging from 1 to 7 nodes, suggests that a random introduction of a novel pathogen would be unlikely to spread to many other herds; At short timescale, the contact chain and degree are nearly synonymous and interchangeable. However, as the timescale increased, differences between distributions of these metrics became evident; knowing the number of outgoing contacts at the time of a disease outbreak is sufficient for knowing the number of potentially infected herds for pathogens with short incubation periods; At and above annual timescale networks, the size of the largest weak component approached the total number of nodes in the network; observed negative degree assortativity coefficients indicate that highly connected herds are less likelybto be connectedbto other highly connected herds","it was not possible to identify movements between Lactanet and non-Lactanet herds; It is reasonable that Lactanet-enrolled herds are, on average, larger than those that do not subscribe to Lactanet services. Smaller herds may not need the services provided by Lactanet and instead have farmer-managed systems in place; Lactanet milk recording data presents several issues with regards to its completeness. Milk testing is paid for by dairy producers and enrollment in these services is voluntary, which is likely to deter at least some producers from participation; If auctions move cows frequently and they do not carefor the milkinghistory of the cow, it is plausible that they may not need Lactanet services; It is possible that omitting the move ments of heifers and bulls has an effect on network connectivity under the assumption that herds engaging in these movements do not also move milking cows; Identification of highly central nodes requires access to longitudinal data that can describethe behaviour of a herdover time, which may not be available in real-time when targeting specific herds for intervention in the middle of an outbreak; It is difficult to directly compare the results of network analyses to published values of other countries given the intrinsic differences that exist between populations","In the absence of complete data, further analysis on the timingand distribution of short-duration loops might identify mass-gathering events. Identification of these events are important as they can contribute to the overall connectivity of the network and can play a role in widespread transmission of disease; To determine the distribution of potential outbreak sizes more accurately, disease modelling with specific pathogen parameters should be investigated; more detailed analysis could be performed to identify the characteristics of a particular highly connected herd and the role it plays as a hub in the network; the various network analysis metrics can be used for parameterizing network-based disease transmission models in the future",

We compute this quantity by averaging on all premises and averaging only on the ones trading at least once a month (defined as active, including both sales and purchases).

In the node sampling schemes, a ‘sampled’ node has all its edges sampled. We consider three methods of node sampling in this paper. In the first method, we use random node sampling (RNS) such that all movements from a certain percentage of nodes are selected. Secondly, we consider second-order SBS, such that an initial set of nodes are sampled and the nodes that this set of nodes are connected to are also sampled. The final node sampling scheme considered targeted node sampling (TNS), where we sample specific nodes based on certain criteria. In this case, we chose the weighted-degree of the node. We investigate the effect of two extreme assumptions of transmission within a market. In the first scenario, we assume no within-market transmission, such that infection is only transmitted between the source and the destination farm. We assume complete segregation between herds being strictly enforced (this would be equivalent to having no markets in the network).

In such countries, it may be impossible to ever record all movement data either owing to the sheer size of the industry (in countries such as the USA) or owing to the cost associated with implementing an animal licence scheme; relies on the assumption that infected movements result in all livestock on the destination farm becoming rapidly infected, which is not the case for all livestock diseases.","While one must take care when making inference from a subnetwork to the full network [28], it would be of great interest to the broader study of disease spread on partially observed networks to test these strategies further on livestock networks such as those available in other European countries; more thorough, disease-specific analysis of the precise role of markets in disease transmission would be required in the future in order to determine context-specific optimal sampling strategies; Future studies will focus upon constructing a dynamic network, and testing network sampling schemes and temporal sampling schemes (whereby sampling is targeted based on time of year) on their ability to predict epidemic behaviour; for countries with similar farming practices, it may not be necessary to collect data on all livestock farms, but only those that contribute most significantly to the livestock trade; all farmers to be required to record the number of movements they make in a given year, allowing for determination of which farms should be sampled for the following year",

However, simply counting the number of nodes that are present in the high-risk areas of the bow-tie provided inflated values of potential epidemic size compared to the infection chain; Compared to the infection chain, the other network-analysis measures evaluated in this study provided biased estimates of the lower and upper bounds of potential epidemic size.","the bow-tie analysis does not account for the sequence of shipments in time; Non-DHI farms could have different movement activity as they tend to include more of the very small and very large herds in the Province (DHI herds are over-represented in the mid-range, 40–100 cows); Information on indirect contacts was not available to us","one could quickly reduce the spread of infections by targeting these highly connected farms for quarantine, and other disease-control and eradication measures; to obtain buy-in from producers in applying good biosecurity practices by showing them the impact hubs might have on infection spread; The decision on which percentile to use for epidemic predictions must therefore be based on the level of fragmentation of the network under study; Monitoring changes to the connectivity of the network over time could give important insights for disease control planning; The movements of other classes and age-groups of dairy animals from farm-to-farm and also through livestock markets and dealers should be investigated to gain a complete understanding of movements of dairy cattle among DHI herds in Ontario.

If shipments based on USAMM accurately describe the shipments of imported cattle, targeting these counties for surveillance will allow more efficient disease surveillance in imported cattle.","Disease surveillance is limited because imported cattle are only tracked to their primary import destination. After importation, the shipments of cattle are broken up, distributed to unknown locations, and mixed, anonymously, with U.S. cattle. As a result, both USAMM and previous descriptions of cattle shipments do not track imported cattle separately from the remainder of the U.S. herd; A key assumption in these descriptive results is that domestic and imported cattle move similarly throughout the U.S. because current datasets do not distinguish between the two populations; shipments were observed for only 10% systematic sample of catte export ICVIs; data does not include shipments intra-state, at a regional level; assumed that imported cattle are shipped individually over one edge of the network. This assumption may result in an overestimate of the total number of counties reached by imported cattle if groups of cattle are moved together; In the U.S., data collection and availability remain the largest challenges for model-guided emergency planning and policy development; All cattle imported into the U.S. are marked with blue ear tags at the time of import. However, cattle may not be re-observed if sampling does not occur in the locations where cattle have moved or if the ear tag was lost or removed.","The temporal resolution required to provide more localscale surveillance or response suggestions should also consider the epidemiology of the pathogen of interest. Whereas, a coarse temporal scale may be suitable for a slowly-transmitting pathogen such as bovine tuberculosis, finer temporal resolution predictions are needed for a rapidly-transmitting pathogen such as the foot-and-mouth disease virus.",

Movements of cattle were obtained, and directionality between farms were displayed in an adjacency matrix and then a transition probability matrix, which indicates the probabilities of animal movements from each farm to connected farms. For the 15 BVD-affected farms, a network plot was described based on movements of the PI cattle and the cattle living with them at their detection, to visualize the hot spot by converting the cattle movements into farm connections. Then, the movement of PI cattle and cattle that connected affected farms were selected, and the network was reconstructed to form a PI network.",PageRank algorithm to assess centrality,N,-," In this study, cattle in the 12 affected farms were introduced from outside, and their movement pathways formed the overlapped network. Furthermore, 80% of the cattle movements in this study were performed by 7.5% of the high-risk facilities, which were 63.5% of farms that made up the PI-network, implying that the emergence of PI cattle can be attributed to cattle movements; Each facility has a different risk of BVD transmission, making the mediated venue important for regional disease transmission so that cattle, even on a farm with cattle movements in few numbers, would potentially be at a high risk by passing the high-risk facilities; BVDV can be introduced from common pastures and maintained within a farm; the market is identified as one of the hot spots of BVDV spread in this region",all the cattle introduced to markets were neither inspected for viral infection nor received a confirmation of vaccination history,"not only PI but also TI cattle should be considered to play a key role in BVD transmission; As the risk of PI cattle emergence is low in common pastures, an acceptance inspection of introduced cattle would be effective for preventing BVD introduction, and is preferred to be implemented in markets as well. Moreover, BVD is introduced to a farm not only by PI cattle movements but also by TI cattle movements, and, therefore, the combined strategy of acceptance inspection and vaccination could be effective for BVD eradication in Japan. We should also understand the risk of disease spread by animal movements and protect healthy cattle from the threat of PI cattle, through appropriate preventive measures, such as inspection and culling or vaccination. The government should also improve its control strategy for comprehensive prevention against BVDV on a regional scale.",

A farm is assumed to become infected when at least one infected animal is moved onto the farm.

After the movement networks among cattle herds in Minnesota was developed, we simulated the within-herd and between-herd bTB transmission for 10 years with a seasonal time step (3 months) using the movement networks, herd locations, and herd demographics. We developed five alternative risk-based surveillance strategies screening high-risk beef or dairy herds, with the initial infection starting in beef or dairy herds, respectively. We projected the effectiveness and cost for slaughter surveillance alone (status quo) and for each alternative risk-based surveillance. Finally, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare between the alternative strategies and slaughter surveillance alone in Minnesota over 10 years. We used 1000 one-year synthetic movement datasets sampled from USAMM in our analysis, restricted to movements involving Minnesota’s 87 counties. We extrapolated the one-year cattle movement data to create a 10-year network. To generate premises-level movements from the county-level data, we assigned each county-level shipment to a pair of herds in the involved counties using a random process that accounted for the characteristics of herds and the distance between herds. Slaughter surveillance was dependent on the annual slaughter rate at the herd level. Following methods developed in VanderWaal et al. (2017), our disease transmission model integrated within-herd transmission and between-herd transmission. We performed 1000 simulations of the spread of bTB in Minnesota for 10 years for each of two scenarios (initial infection occurring either in a beef herd -beef scenario- or in a dairy herd -dairy scenario). We developed alternative risk-based surveillance strategies targeting high-risk herds for additional testing to complement the existing slaughter surveillance.

However, if a large outbreak occurred (e.g., 10% worst-case simulations) or multiple undetected infections were circulating in an area (e.g., infection started in five or more herds), slaughter surveillance alone may not be sufficient to detect all infections in the affected area, with ongoing infection still occurring after 10 years. Even the most efficient alternative strategy cost $17.7 million more than slaughter surveillance per infection averted, suggesting that slaughter surveillance alone was preferred if no immediate risk of infection was suspected. However, alternative risk-based surveillance could shorten the time to first detection of infection by more than 8 months, and could allow the state to reach disease freedom at a higher probability and several months earlier. Alternative surveillance shortened the time to first detection more in beef herds than in dairy herds. Testing high-risk herds of all types is likely to substantially increase the surveillance costs, which are already expensive, and avert a very small number of infected herds","lack of data on locations of heifer raisers; Surveillance of very low prevalence diseases is a continual challenge for animal health authorities; lack of data on premises-level cattle movements in the United States; The simulation for shipment size and frequency relied on national statistics reported in the NAHMS studies, which may not be specificto Minnesota; model did not consider the correlation between in- and out-shipments due to lack of data; because we did not have the locations of all of the herds involved in the bTB outbreak in northern Minnesota, we were unable to estimate Minnesota-specific parameters of the kernel function controlling local bTB spread","more active surveillance such as routine screening of high-risk herds in areas with suspected ongoing infection could be a feasible option; Risk-based surveillance is one option, as routine risk-based testing could allocate the limited resources to the sites at increased-risk or with suspected infection; the current slaughter surveillance strategies implemented in Minnesota provide efficient detection and prevention of bTB outbreaks relative to strategies that employ routine testing of high-risk herds.

We assume a closed system of N farms and summarize between-farm heterogeneity in terms of a small number of farm-level constants. Under the model, each farm possesses a dynamic list detailing which farms they can purchase animals from at a given time. Purchasing farms continually seek to optimize their trading partners. The dynamics of disease are coupled with partnership dynamics and trade behaviour by assuming disease is driven entirely by animal movements, neglecting indirect transmission such as from external wildlife sources or distance modulated local infection.

The main factor that could change the network activity of the German pig trade network is likely to be the farm size. If an increase in the network activity is to be expected in the long term, the probability for an outbreak and outbreak size are likely to increase. The final outbreak size for different network activities shows, strong similarities to the threshold behavior known from epidemic SIR-type models, and epidemic threshold positions vary with transmission probability.

Monitoring the changes in the structure of this market trade network is needed; Further studies on the movement of live pigs among local farms are needed; A more comprehensive national database should be established in China.",

Effective institutions at grass root level with robust higher level linkages are required to manage this broader risk.","veterinary response during ASF outbreaks should include quarantine at village level and potentially to adjoining villages; Transboundary cooperation is critical in control of ASF and has been developing in recent years between Uganda and Kenya veterinary authorities; The specialization that some smallholders have developed in breeding piglets and selling them to other smallholders for rearing indicates that they could be usefully enlisted as hubs for information dissemination about biosecurity and other aspects of pig husbandry; Incentives that encourage disease reporting rather than distress-selling to strangers, as well as measures that take account of the characteristics of pig movement networks and the close social ties that underpin these, are important for more effective ASF risk management",

The network rewiring used here changes the structure of the recorded trade network through a combination of altered movement restrictions and redirection of movements between holdings and markets to avoid nonsensical activity (e.g. movements to markets on days when they are inactive) while conserving other characteristics (e.g. movement date as closely as possible and market sales of the correct animal production type).,GB-SCT,N,-,cattle; sheep,cattle tracing system (CTS) and the Scottish Animal Movement System (SAMS); Scottish Animal Movement Unit (SAMU) and British Sheep and Goat Inventory; Agricultural Census,1 Jan 2011,31 Dec 2013,Y,focus on standstill period of 13 days after a movement ban had been taken effect,N,greater detail of the CTS database,N,N,N,Y,standstill violation; sheep or cattle,Y,simulated FMD,animal holding,19924 sheep holdings (4584 in standstill period); 9723 cattle holdings in standstill period,animal movements,193792 sheep movements (39686 in standstill period with 20761 identified as breaching regulations); 20990 cattle movements in standstill period (10964 violating standstill rules),N,-,movements from animal holdings direct to slaughter or to slaughter via a market are exempt from the 13-day standstill rule and were excluded from further analysis; Movements that could be clearly attributed as being exempt from standstill regulations were excluded from the data,324 (recorded movements plus 8 rewiring scenarios) plus 1000 epidemic simulations,Y,Y,monthly,R,"The individual movement records were batched in order to calculate holding level standstill exemptions and combined with the batched sheep movements. Standstill periods were calculated as follows: for each unique destination premises we retrieved all subsequent movements leaving this particular holding and calculated the waiting time with respect to the earlier on-movement. Each movement falling into the standstill period (less than 13 days) but for which no exemptions were explicitly identified, were marked as movements breaking the standstill regulations. We used recorded livestock movements to generate rewired contact networks by re-directing movements to markets (which could potentially carry higher risk), based on changes in farmer activity that are economically sensible and that could be theoretically implemented by adjusting the existing legislation. To investigate legislative changes in movement restrictions and market trade patterns, a 4-week period (with an additional 2-week burn-in period) of recorded livestock movements was determined as sufficient. We generated 8 sets of movement networks based on a 4-week period of recorded sheep and cattle movements (October 2010) through the combinations of standstill length (6 or 13 days), standstill exemption (yes or no), and market-rewire (yes or no)). To account for existing standstill exemptions, exempt movements were identified and removed during rewiring before applying structural changes to the livestock movement network. These movements were reinserted at the final stage of rewiring. We developed a spatial stochastic model of FMD transmission and control (adapted from Green et al. (2006)) to investigate the impact of changed standstill regulations and of structural changes to the livestock movement network through a combinations of: (i) two different movement restriction regimes (by applying either a 13-day standstill or 6-day standstills after livestock are moved onto an agricultural holding), (ii) two different rewiring regimes (re-directing movements to the nearest market of the same production type or not), (iii) two different exemption regimes (either exemptions to the standstill regulations were allowed or there were no exemptions). In FMD simulations, we simulated control measures using two mechanisms: (i) detection of infectious premises after a certain number of days with clinical signs and (ii) contact tracing of on- and off-movements to target serological examinations at farms that could have received infected animals. Simulations were set to start at 20 randomly selected dates throughout the specified month and this process was replicated at the beginning of each simulation to introduce additional stochastic variation.",betweenness; degree; in-degree; out-degree; density; degree assortativity; average path length; diameter; density; strong connected components; weak connected components; GSCC; clustering coefficient,N,-,"the static network measures appear to be good predictors for the outcome of the simulations, resulting in smaller epidemics on all rewired scenarios; Investigating the epidemic size for the FMD simulation on the rewired networks compared to the FMD simulation output of the empirically observed network clearly shows that the presence of standstill exemptions will increase the probability of resulting in a larger epidemic size, independent of the length of the standstill; Our results suggest that explicitly manipulating the contact network structure in a sensible way has the potential to significantly impact disease control","numerous deficiencies and inconsistencies in the available data prevent the full scope of movements during the standstill period from being appropriately categorised; Given that many standstill exemptions refer to individual animal characteristics, we were not able to accurately identify these exemptions for the batched sheep data (greater detail of the CTS database, which showed individual cattle data)","Some movements violating the standstill restrictions may also result from confusion over the rules (Hunting, 2006), and it may be beneficial to take investigations into farmer behaviour and their perception of the standstill regime into consideration; the large number of movements in an apparent restriction period indicate that a simpler biosecurity system with shorter standstills but no exemptions, which would likely be easier to legislate for and monitor, would offer no substantial additional risk for FMD",

We identified the largest three clusters of closely related sequences from the phylogenetic tree, then conducted further analyses for each cluster separately. The animal movement data used in this study were directly obtained from the two participating production systems, which electronically recorded all farm-to-farm movements of pigs. We constructed time-scaled phylogenies for the clusters. To infer transmission networks from the MCC trees, we conducted transmission tree analysis. To parameterize the model priors, we assumed that the observed transmission processes were part of an ongoing outbreak. In order to translate the transmission network from the animal level to the farm level, we used the farm ID associated with each sequence to create a farm-level transmission network, assuming that the virus must have moved between farms somewhere along the pig-to-pig infection chain inferred in the transmission network analysis. We used animal movement data to identify “known” direct transmission events, wherein direct farm-to-farm transmission can be reasonably assumed if an animal movement occurred between the farms during the infection window. We created a time-stamped dynamic movement network and extracted the shortest path between the samples existing during the infection window of every sampled pair. Since the farm-level R can be calculated only from direct farm-to-farm transmission, we assumed that direct farm-to-farm transmission had occurred in any case where the infection chain was shorter than the median of ICL at MPL of 1 (regardless of the presence of documented animal movement) and used the resulting farm-to-farm transmission events to create a farm-level transmission network. Two sensitivty analyses were performed, and farm-level R values were computed. Farm-level metadata, including location and production type, were utilized to investigate potential modes of transmission between farms beyond animal movement.

Such edges could be weighted by the number of shipments or pigs, and analysis was done with weighted and unweighted edges. The small-world and scale free topologies, the centrality parameters and the percolation analysis were performed by assuming snapshots of 1-month resolution for the whole period of 3 years. The small-world topology was assessed by constructing 1,000 random Erdos-Renyi networks containing the same number of nodes and edges of each monthly network snapshots. The heterogeneity in the contact rate of a network structure was considered to assess its multiplicative effect on the Basic Reproduction Number (R0). A percolation analysis was performed to identify those farms that are key in the dissemination of an infectious disease through the multisite system.

We mainly use year 2015, and check that the results are consistent for other time periods.The temporal variations of active nodes, heterogeneity of nodes and degree activity, and asymmetry of interactions were evaluated. We compare the results obtained when the data is described with static graph snapshots to the case where the data is described as a truly temporal network when considering which nodes can be reached by the infection, knowing already infected nodes. In the context of temporal networks, we define what we call a spreading cascade, and we simulate a deterministic SI spreading model starting from aseed node at a given time,with an infection active only during a predefined period of time. We now compare experimentally the potential sizes of the outbreaks according to the SI model with the snapshot-based representation and with the link stream representation using the measurements aforementioned. Then, we investigated on the data how the AUIC depends on the final number of infected nodes in a cascade. In order to explain the scatter plot described in the previous section, we propose a simple model of the number of infected nodes as a function of time. We consider three key elements underlying this method to assess epidemic control strategies: the cost of a strategry, the epidemic risk evaluation, and the evaluation of the centrality of a node or link. We analyze the efficiency of target control strategies in the following way: first we rank nodes, links or triplets according to some centrality measurement. Then, we delete a given fraction of the top-ranked triplets and run the SI spreading model on the remaining structure. We evaluate the efficiency of the strategy by measuring the AUIC (and the size, not reported here) of the cascades. We evaluate if the strategies identified in the previous section can be used for risk prediction. So we apply the same experimental protocol, except for the fact that we use data from the previous year (in our experiments, 2014) to rank nodes, links or triplets; and evaluate the strategies by running the SI model on the following year (2015).

All of the movements between two specific holdings during the time period were then condensed into a single arc. Initial analysis involved calculating several parameters to characterize networks and then identifying components or communities of nodes for different time scales. Outgoing and incoming shipment movements were ranked by date/h. Movements involved in a round were replaced by direct movements between holdings. We assumed that animals unloaded at a holding could have had contacts with all of the animals loaded previously during the round. Therefore, holdings where animals had been unloaded during a given round were linked to each of the holdings where animals had been loaded before, during the same round.

Second, this reflects the dynamic nature of the swine industry with downward movements through the pyramidal structure where all holdings could play a role in disease spread along the production process; dealer holdings had higher centrality values than the other holdings but represented 0.19% of the population; the swine trade network appeared less structurally vulnerable than ruminant trade networks","Although rich in their data content, the two-mode networks are, however, difficult to interpret; data reflects trade activity for only 6 months, as registration has only recently been made mandatory; lack of precision or error-rate due to self-reporting could introduce some bias in the analysis; because of the trend of French herds to integrate several production units, no production types could be suggested for targeting","some holdings should certainly be targeted, as, for example, sow pool herds where sows are inseminated in a central unit and farrow in satellite herds or, inversely, finishing herds, which collect piglets from numerous breeding herds",

This id number could not be used to determine the exact identity of the premises; The types of premises were not considered in the study, which precludes any inference about type-specific behavior of interest; A further issue related to the shipment data to which USAMM was fitted was that the various data sets were not collected during the same time periods; ultimately the model results are based purely on patterns that can be determined from such interstate shipment data, and does not consider empirical data on within-state shipments; predictions based on much more recent data would provide a much higher level of detail than what the comparison to the NASS census and survey is capable of.","without a set of data that describes within-state shipments, the uncertainty regarding these issues are impossible to quantify. If such a data set was available it could be used to validate the predictions of within-state shipments that USAMM produce, and in that way assess the amount of error resulting from this bias.

A spatial network, created by connecting each ward to all its spatially adjacent wards, was added to the market movement network, as a means of accounting for contacts that occur between wards through sharing of grazing and water sources, and movements of animals through gifting and private sales. We used the combined monthly market movement networks to generate a static directed weighted network over a year, which was then used to calculate network measures. The spatial network was excluded from the calculation of network measures because we expect targeting strategies would be guided by market network data in real policy situations. We generated unweighted theoretical networks with an equal number of nodes and mean degree as the monthly “unweighted mean market movement"" network to explore the effect of varying network structures on results. These included Erd ̋ os-Rényi (ER) random networks, scale-free networks, and small-world networks. The data-driven network is weighted. Its unweighted version has a mean degree of 4, like the theoretical networks, which are unweighted. To calculate RVF introduction risk, the average monthly NDVI raster for the study area between January 2000 and December 2017 was divided by wards into grid cells. The risk score of a ward in the data-driven network is the proportion of cells of the ward that has an NDVI value between 0.15 and 0.4. In theoretical networks, risk scores were randomly distributed.

We examined whether multicollinearity was an issue in the models using Pearson correlation and through an examination of the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). We first built a regression model using Herd size, Herd type, In strength, Trades in, Betweenness, Rainfall, Altitude, Badger Metric as independent variables. We created a simple model, which consisted of the Base Model with the addition of an ICC variable, and a “History and Proximity Model” model, which additionally included the TB_13–17 and measures of proximity to infected herds variables. We created a third set of models using the same set of variables as used in the History and Proximity Model with the addition of the County variable, which we will refer to as the “Counties Model”.

This stochastic model tracked transmission processes both within infected farms and allowed transmission to occur between farms by either movement of infected animals or through a local spatial transmission kernel. The total number (batch size b) of adults or calves moved in the model was drawn from a Poisson distribution centered on the observed batch size for the specific age-class in that particular movement in the movement database. Local spread occurs via a spatial transmission kernel, where the probability of transmission decreases as two farms become farther apart.The model was always seeded in dairy farms. Any farm with at least one detected animal is reclassified as a detected farm and control measures based on the current test-and-cull control program utilized within Uruguay are implemented. For simplicity, we consider control measures to be perfect in that no illegal movements occur and that the farm also no longer contributes to local spatial spread. In addition to control measures on detected farms, contact tracing occurs for all of the farm’s connections in the movement network for a period of two years prior to the detection date. We conducted a multivariate calibration exercise on parameters directly involved with between-farm transmission and surveillance using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) analyses. One hundred simulations were conducted per parameter set, yielding 50,000 simulations. Each simulation set ran on the same 100 sets of index cases to eliminate variability associated with index case choice. A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimize parameter values in the model so that simulations matched observed epidemiological dynamics. We applied the tuned GA to the real-world data to estimate parameter values. 1000 simulations were then performed with the GA-fitted parameter values to validate model performance. Risk classes were defined using a combination of criteria based on the number of animals received by a farm in the previous three years and the herd size of the farm.

However, in contrast to our theoretical predictions, we find that the year-long weighted static network gives rise to larger epidemics than the fully dynamic network; the worst-case scenario being considerably underestimated if a weighted static network representation were used to inform policy making; by plotting early epidemic growth against final epidemic size, we have shown that these differences are systematic and cannot be removed by a simple rescaling of epidemiological parameters; even if network models are all parameterized to match the same observed early epidemic behaviour, they fail to agree with predictions of final epidemic size",-,"While simpler network representations of the UK cattle herd have their advantages, these results show that great care must be taken if such representations are to be used for epidemiological prediction; if network models are to be employed to investigate infectious diseases in the UK cattle herd, and used to make detailed quantitative predictions, then they should be based upon dynamic directed network representations of the available movement data",

Furthermore, the median outbreak size at the time point of detection was lower for the dynamic targeted surveillance than for any other scheme. Surprisingly, surveillance based on monthly network measures was even less effective than surveillance based on randomly selected sentinel holding; changes in the risk of epidemic outbreaks are a consequence of changes in connectivity of the network, which is a consequence of the seasonal cycle; Static descriptors of monthly transport networks give only poor predictors for the outbreak risk emanating from individual holdings; yet a dynamic measure based on time-stamped data—the outgoing contact chain—can give better risk estimates and could help to improve surveillance schemes.

The spatial scale of the communities we have identified is regional; that is, they are subnational but larger than individual provinces.","although we have proved the feasibility of using a gravity model to reconstruct the live poultry trade network and have found a live poultry trade network that could explain the observed gene flow, uncertainties between the gravity model and disease spread still exist (as movements were inferred) and should be addressed in future work. Second, even though we have tried to avoid the limits of multiresolution modularity and have demonstrated community structure robustness, we note that the detected live poultry trade communities (LPTCs) are not unique; that is, there is no unique way to define the best partition of a network.","prevent potential AIV introduction into unaffected but high-risk localities, it is important to assess the position of potential recipient locations within the community structure",

On top of the contact network, we add an information-sharing layer to simulate the influence of different information-sharing networks and the participation level on suppressing the epidemic. Thus, each network was formed by three independent layers. In the direct-contact layer LDC, every cattle movement is generated as a directed and weighted edge from the departure premise (node) pointing to the destination one, with the weight as the headcount of transported cattle. For the indirect-contact layer LIC, the edges within are undirected. We design three information-sharing layer LIS with different network structure but same network density. The first type is an Erdos Renyi random network. The second one is the contact-based network, where the premises share their infection status with their business partners. The third one is based on the geographic distance between premises, where the premises whose distance is shorter than 450 km are connected. Finally, the infection status of each node on every layer is aggregated to the multilayer network. We construct 26 time-series multilayer networks in total. To describe the transition process of infection status on each premise, we propose a susceptible-quarantined-exposed-infectious-removed (SQEIR) model. The hypothetical FMD spreading is simulated on a weekly-series of DCN, D&ICN, and multilayer network with contacts layers and information layer (DIC&ISN). A sensitivity analysis of the potential economic loss from the epidemic and quarantine was also performed.",density; degree distribution; average degree,N,-,"In this study, we firstly conducted hypothetical FMD spreads on a single-layer DCN, a two-layer D&ICN, and a three-layer DIC&ISN, where the results show that the FMD has larger epidemic size and long duration on the two-layer D&ICN than the single-layer DCN, and that the information-sharing layer is able to mitigate the spread of the disease. These results re-addressed the significant influence of the truck visits on the between-farm transmission of FMD virus, and revealed that truck-visit routes can greatly enlarge the outbreak epidemic size, but have limited influence on increasing the outbreak probability; we found that the losses with contact-based ISN is the smallest under any participation and relative quarantine loss pair, and that an increased participation level generally leads to a deceased economic loss when the quarantine costs are negligible; an 80% participation level in contact-based information sharing is able to display fairly good performance on reducing the economic losses","did not consider other indirect contacts, such as personnel visits and air-borne transmission; did not consider auction markets","the regional animal disease control agencies should take actions to reduce direct-contact rate and control the cattle movements in the early stage of the epidemic to prevent the outbreak. For existing outbreaks, increasing truck sterilization frequency and limiting truck visits are useful policies to mitigate the epidemic size; The regional agencies could work on calling more farms to participate in the contact-based information-sharing network to ensure that the infection status of the farms is accessible to their business partners",
